Adversarially Guided Self-Play for Adopting Social Conventions,"Robotic agents must adopt existing social conventions in order to be
effective teammates. These social conventions, such as driving on the right or
left side of the road, are arbitrary choices among optimal policies, but all
agents on a successful team must use the same convention. Prior work has
identified a method of combining self-play with paired input-output data
gathered from existing agents in order to learn their social convention without
interacting with them. We build upon this work by introducing a technique
called Adversarial Self-Play (ASP) that uses adversarial training to shape the
space of possible learned policies and substantially improves learning
efficiency. ASP only requires the addition of unpaired data: a dataset of
outputs produced by the social convention without associated inputs.
Theoretical analysis reveals how ASP shapes the policy space and the
circumstances (when behaviors are clustered or exhibit some other structure)
under which it offers the greatest benefits. Empirical results across three
domains confirm ASP's advantages: it produces models that more closely match
the desired social convention when given as few as two paired datapoints.",cs.AI,"cs.RO, cs.MA, cs.AI",3,Artificial Intelligence,"Robotics, Multiagent Systems, Artificial Intelligence",Julie Shah,"Mycal Tucker, Yilun Zhou, Julie Shah",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05994v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05994v1,2020-01-16
"#MeToo on Campus: Studying College Sexual Assault at Scale Using Data
  Reported on Social Media","Recently, the emergence of the #MeToo trend on social media has empowered
thousands of people to share their own sexual harassment experiences. This
viral trend, in conjunction with the massive personal information and content
available on Twitter, presents a promising opportunity to extract data driven
insights to complement the ongoing survey based studies about sexual harassment
in college. In this paper, we analyze the influence of the #MeToo trend on a
pool of college followers. The results show that the majority of topics
embedded in those #MeToo tweets detail sexual harassment stories, and there
exists a significant correlation between the prevalence of this trend and
official reports on several major geographical regions. Furthermore, we
discover the outstanding sentiments of the #MeToo tweets using deep semantic
meaning representations and their implications on the affected users
experiencing different types of sexual harassment. We hope this study can raise
further awareness regarding sexual misconduct in academia.",cs.SI,"cs.MM, cs.SI, cs.CL, cs.AI",4,Social and Information Networks,"Multimedia, Social and Information Networks, Computation and Language, Artificial Intelligence",Jiebo Luo,"Viet Duong, Phu Pham, Ritwik Bose, Jiebo Luo",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05970v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05970v1,2020-01-16
"On Expert Behaviors and Question Types for Efficient Query-Based
  Ontology Fault Localization","We challenge existing query-based ontology fault localization methods wrt.
assumptions they make, criteria they optimize, and interaction means they use.
We find that their efficiency depends largely on the behavior of the
interacting expert, that performed calculations can be inefficient or
imprecise, and that used optimization criteria are often not fully realistic.
As a remedy, we suggest a novel (and simpler) interaction approach which
overcomes all identified problems and, in comprehensive experiments on faulty
real-world ontologies, enables a successful fault localization while requiring
fewer expert interactions in 66 % of the cases, and always at least 80 % less
expert waiting time, compared to existing methods.",cs.AI,"cs.LO, cs.PF, cs.HC, cs.AI",4,Artificial Intelligence,"Logic in Computer Science, Performance, Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence",Patrick Rodler,Patrick Rodler,1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05952v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05952v1,2020-01-16
Broadening Label-based Argumentation Semantics with May-Must Scales,"The semantics as to which set of arguments in a given argumentation graph may
be acceptable (acceptability semantics) can be characterised in a few different
ways. Among them, labelling-based approach allows for concise and flexible
determination of acceptability statuses of arguments through assignment of a
label indicating acceptance, rejection, or undecided to each argument. In this
work, we contemplate a way of broadening it by accommodating may- and must-
conditions for an argument to be accepted or rejected, as determined by the
number(s) of rejected and accepted attacking arguments. We show that the
broadened label-based semantics can be used to express more mild indeterminacy
than inconsistency for acceptability judgement when, for example, it may be the
case that an argument is accepted and when it may also be the case that it is
rejected. We identify that finding which conditions a labelling satisfies for
every argument can be an undecidable problem, which has an unfavourable
implication to semantics. We propose to address this problem by enforcing a
labelling to maximally respect the conditions, while keeping the rest that
would necessarily cause non-termination labelled undecided.",cs.AI,cs.AI,1,Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence,Takayuki Ito,"Ryuta Arisaka, Takayuki Ito",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05730v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05730v1,2020-01-16
Graph Attentional Autoencoder for Anticancer Hyperfood Prediction,"Recent research efforts have shown the possibility to discover anticancer
drug-like molecules in food from their effect on protein-protein interaction
networks, opening a potential pathway to disease-beating diet design. We
formulate this task as a graph classification problem on which graph neural
networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results. However, GNNs are
difficult to train on sparse low-dimensional features according to our
empirical evidence. Here, we present graph augmented features, integrating
graph structural information and raw node attributes with varying ratios, to
ease the training of networks. We further introduce a novel neural network
architecture on graphs, the Graph Attentional Autoencoder (GAA) to predict food
compounds with anticancer properties based on perturbed protein networks. We
demonstrate that the method outperforms the baseline approach and
state-of-the-art graph classification models in this task.",cs.LG,"cs.LG, cs.AI",2,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence",Michael Bronstein,"Guadalupe Gonzalez, Shunwang Gong, Ivan Laponogov, Kirill Veselkov, Michael Bronstein",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05724v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05724v1,2020-01-16
"A Common Operating Picture Framework Leveraging Data Fusion and Deep
  Learning","Organizations are starting to realize of the combined power of data and
data-driven algorithmic models to gain insights, situational awareness, and
advance their mission. A common challenge to gaining insights is connecting
inherently different datasets. These datasets (e.g. geocoded features, video
streams, raw text, social network data, etc.) per separate they provide very
narrow answers; however collectively they can provide new capabilities. In this
work, we present a data fusion framework for accelerating solutions for
Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED). Our platform is a collection
of services that extract information from several data sources (per separate)
by leveraging deep learning and other means of processing. This information is
fused by a set of analytical engines that perform data correlations, searches,
and other modeling operations to combine information from the disparate data
sources. As a result, events of interest are detected, geolocated, logged, and
presented into a common operating picture. This common operating picture allows
the user to visualize in real time all the data sources, per separate and their
collective cooperation. In addition, forensic activities have been implemented
and made available through the framework. Users can review archived results and
compare them to the most recent snapshot of the operational environment. In our
first iteration we have focused on visual data (FMV, WAMI, CCTV/PTZ-Cameras,
open source video, etc.) and AIS data streams (satellite and terrestrial
sources). As a proof-of-concept, in our experiments we show how FMV detections
can be combined with vessel tracking signals from AIS sources to confirm
identity, tip-and-cue aerial reconnaissance, and monitor vessel activity in an
area.",cs.CV,cs.CV,1,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Marc Bosch,"Benjamin Ortiz, David Lindenbaum, Joseph Nassar, Brendan Lammers, John Wahl, Robert Mangum, Margaret Smith, Marc Bosch",8,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05982v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05982v1,2020-01-16
"Contextual Sense Making by Fusing Scene Classification, Detections, and
  Events in Full Motion Video","With the proliferation of imaging sensors, the volume of multi-modal imagery
far exceeds the ability of human analysts to adequately consume and exploit it.
Full motion video (FMV) possesses the extra challenge of containing large
amounts of redundant temporal data. We aim to address the needs of human
analysts to consume and exploit data given aerial FMV. We have investigated and
designed a system capable of detecting events and activities of interest that
deviate from the baseline patterns of observation given FMV feeds. We have
divided the problem into three tasks: (1) Context awareness, (2) object
cataloging, and (3) event detection. The goal of context awareness is to
constraint the problem of visual search and detection in video data. A custom
image classifier categorizes the scene with one or multiple labels to identify
the operating context and environment. This step helps reducing the semantic
search space of downstream tasks in order to increase their accuracy. The
second step is object cataloging, where an ensemble of object detectors locates
and labels any known objects found in the scene (people, vehicles, boats,
planes, buildings, etc.). Finally, context information and detections are sent
to the event detection engine to monitor for certain behaviors. A series of
analytics monitor the scene by tracking object counts, and object interactions.
If these object interactions are not declared to be commonly observed in the
current scene, the system will report, geolocate, and log the event. Events of
interest include identifying a gathering of people as a meeting and/or a crowd,
alerting when there are boats on a beach unloading cargo, increased count of
people entering a building, people getting in and/or out of vehicles of
interest, etc. We have applied our methods on data from different sensors at
different resolutions in a variety of geographical areas.",cs.CV,cs.CV,1,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Margaret Smith,"Marc Bosch, Joseph Nassar, Benjamin Ortiz, Brendan Lammers, David Lindenbaum, John Wahl, Robert Mangum, Margaret Smith",8,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05979v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05979v1,2020-01-16
MeliusNet: Can Binary Neural Networks Achieve MobileNet-level Accuracy?,"Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are neural networks which use binary weights
and activations instead of the typical 32-bit floating point values. They have
reduced model sizes and allow for efficient inference on mobile or embedded
devices with limited power and computational resources. However, the
binarization of weights and activations leads to feature maps of lower quality
and lower capacity and thus a drop in accuracy compared to traditional
networks. Previous work has increased the number of channels or used multiple
binary bases to alleviate these problems. In this paper, we instead present
MeliusNet consisting of alternating two block designs, which consecutively
increase the number of features and then improve the quality of these features.
In addition, we propose a redesign of those layers that use 32-bit values in
previous approaches to reduce the required number of operations. Experiments on
the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our MeliusNet over
a variety of popular binary architectures with regards to both computation
savings and accuracy. Furthermore, with our method we trained BNN models, which
for the first time can match the accuracy of the popular compact network
MobileNet in terms of model size and accuracy. Our code is published online:

"Road Network and Travel Time Extraction from Multiple Look Angles with
  SpaceNet Data","Identification of road networks and optimal routes directly from remote
sensing is of critical importance to a broad array of humanitarian and
commercial applications. Yet while identification of road pixels has been
attempted before, estimation of route travel times from overhead imagery
remains a novel problem, particularly for off-nadir overhead imagery. To this
end, we extract road networks with travel time estimates from the SpaceNet MVOI
dataset. Utilizing the CRESIv2 framework, we demonstrate the ability to extract
road networks in various observation angles and quantify performance at 27
unique nadir angles with the graph-theoretic APLS_length and APLS_time metrics.
A minimal gap of 0.03 between APLS_length and APLS_time scores indicates that
our approach yields speed limits and travel times with very high fidelity. We
also explore the utility of incorporating all available angles during model
training, and find a peak score of APLS_time = 0.56. The combined model
exhibits greatly improved robustness over angle-specific models, despite the
very different appearance of road networks at extremely oblique off-nadir
angles versus images captured from directly overhead.",cs.CV,cs.CV,1,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Ryan Lewis,"Adam Van Etten, Jacob Shermeyer, Daniel Hogan, Nicholas Weir, Ryan Lewis",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05923v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05923v1,2020-01-16
Continual Learning for Domain Adaptation in Chest X-ray Classification,"Over the last years, Deep Learning has been successfully applied to a broad
range of medical applications. Especially in the context of chest X-ray
classification, results have been reported which are on par, or even superior
to experienced radiologists. Despite this success in controlled experimental
environments, it has been noted that the ability of Deep Learning models to
generalize to data from a new domain (with potentially different tasks) is
often limited. In order to address this challenge, we investigate techniques
from the field of Continual Learning (CL) including Joint Training (JT),
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Learning Without Forgetting (LWF). Using
the ChestX-ray14 and the MIMIC-CXR datasets, we demonstrate empirically that
these methods provide promising options to improve the performance of Deep
Learning models on a target domain and to mitigate effectively catastrophic
forgetting for the source domain. To this end, the best overall performance was
obtained using JT, while for LWF competitive results could be achieved - even
without accessing data from the source domain.",cs.CV,"cs.CV, cs.LG",2,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Axel Saalbach,"Matthias Lenga, Heinrich Schulz, Axel Saalbach",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05922v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05922v1,2020-01-16
MixPath: A Unified Approach for One-shot Neural Architecture Search,"The expressiveness of search space is a key concern in neural architecture
search (NAS). Previous block-level approaches mainly focus on searching
networks that chain one operation after another. Incorporating multi-path
search space with the one-shot doctrine remains untackled. In this paper, we
investigate the supernet behavior under the multi-path setting, which we call
MixPath. For a sampled training, simply switching multiple paths on and off
incurs severe feature inconsistency which deteriorates the convergence. To
remedy this effect, we employ what we term as \emph{shadow batch
normalizations} (SBN) to follow various path patterns. Experiments performed on
CIFAR-10 show that our approach is effective regardless of the number of
allowable paths. Further experiments are conducted on ImageNet to have a fair
comparison with the latest NAS methods. Our code will be available

A Little Fog for a Large Turn,"Small, carefully crafted perturbations called adversarial perturbations can
easily fool neural networks. However, these perturbations are largely additive
and not naturally found. We turn our attention to the field of Autonomous
navigation wherein adverse weather conditions such as fog have a drastic effect
on the predictions of these systems. These weather conditions are capable of
acting like natural adversaries that can help in testing models. To this end,
we introduce a general notion of adversarial perturbations, which can be
created using generative models and provide a methodology inspired by
Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks to generate adversarial
weather conditions for a given image. Our formulation and results show that
these images provide a suitable testbed for steering models used in Autonomous
navigation models. Our work also presents a more natural and general definition
of Adversarial perturbations based on Perceptual Similarity.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, cs.LG, cs.CV, eess.IV",4,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Image and Video Processing",Vineeth N Balasubramanian,"Harshitha Machiraju, Vineeth N Balasubramanian",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05873v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05873v1,2020-01-16
ScaIL: Classifier Weights Scaling for Class Incremental Learning,"Incremental learning is useful if an AI agent needs to integrate data from a
stream. The problem is non trivial if the agent runs on a limited computational
budget and has a bounded memory of past data. In a deep learning approach, the
constant computational budget requires the use of a fixed architecture for all
incremental states. The bounded memory generates data imbalance in favor of new
classes and a prediction bias toward them appears. This bias is commonly
countered by introducing a data balancing step in addition to the basic network
training. We depart from this approach and propose simple but efficient scaling
of past class classifier weights to make them more comparable to those of new
classes. Scaling exploits incremental state level statistics and is applied to
the classifiers learned in the initial state of classes in order to profit from
all their available data. We also question the utility of the widely used
distillation loss component of incremental learning algorithms by comparing it
to vanilla fine tuning in presence of a bounded memory. Evaluation is done
against competitive baselines using four public datasets. Results show that the
classifier weights scaling and the removal of the distillation are both
beneficial.",cs.CV,cs.CV,1,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Adrian Popescu,"Eden Belouadah, Adrian Popescu",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05755v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05755v1,2020-01-16
"Probabilistic 3D Multilabel Real-time Mapping for Multi-object
  Manipulation","Probabilistic 3D map has been applied to object segmentation with multiple
camera viewpoints, however, conventional methods lack of real-time efficiency
and functionality of multilabel object mapping. In this paper, we propose a
method to generate three-dimensional map with multilabel occupancy in
real-time. Extending our previous work in which only target label occupancy is
mapped, we achieve multilabel object segmentation in a single looking around
action. We evaluate our method by testing segmentation accuracy with 39
different objects, and applying it to a manipulation task of multiple objects
in the experiments. Our mapping-based method outperforms the conventional
projection-based method by 40 - 96\% relative (12.6 mean $IU_{3d}$), and robot
successfully recognizes (86.9\%) and manipulates multiple objects (60.7\%) in

"A Technology-aided Multi-modal Training Approach to Assist Abdominal
  Palpation Training and its Assessment in Medical Education","Computer-assisted multimodal training is an effective way of learning complex
motor skills in various applications. In particular disciplines (eg.
healthcare) incompetency in performing dexterous hands-on examinations
(clinical palpation) may result in misdiagnosis of symptoms, serious injuries
or even death. Furthermore, a high quality clinical examination can help to
exclude significant pathology, and reduce time and cost of diagnosis by
eliminating the need for unnecessary medical imaging. Medical palpation is used
regularly as an effective preliminary diagnosis method all around the world but
years of training are required currently to achieve competency. This paper
focuses on a multimodal palpation training system to teach and improve clinical
examination skills in relation to the abdomen. It is our aim to shorten
significantly the palpation training duration by increasing the frequency of
rehearsals as well as providing essential augmented feedback on how to perform
various abdominal palpation techniques which has been captured and modelled
from medical experts. Twenty three first year medical students divided into a
control group (n=8), a semi-visually trained group (n=8), and a fully visually
trained group (n=7) were invited to perform three palpation tasks (superficial,
deep and liver). The medical students performances were assessed using both
computer-based and human-based methods where a positive correlation was shown
between the generated scores, r=.62, p(one-tailed)<.05. The visually-trained
group significantly outperformed the control group in which abstract
visualisation of applied forces and their palmar locations were provided to the
students during each palpation examination (p<.05). Moreover, a positive trend
was observed between groups when visual feedback was presented, J=132, z=2.62,

where we take as input multiple freehand sketches with different views of the
same object and predict semantic correspondence among the sketches. This
problem is challenging, since visual features of corresponding points at
different views can be very different. To this end, we take a deep learning
approach and learn a novel local sketch descriptor from data. We contribute a
training dataset by generating the pixel-level correspondence for the
multi-view line drawings synthesized from 3D shapes. To handle the sparsity and
ambiguity of sketches, we design a novel multi-branch neural network that
integrates a patch-based representation and a multi-scale strategy to learn the

Adaptive Direction-Guided Structure Tensor Total Variation,"Direction-guided structure tensor total variation (DSTV) is a recently
proposed regularization term that aims at increasing the sensitivity of the
structure tensor total variation (STV) to the changes towards a predetermined
direction. Despite of the plausible results obtained on the uni-directional
images, the DSTV model is not applicable to the multi-directional images of
real-world. In this study, we build a two-stage framework that brings
adaptivity to DSTV. We design an alternative to STV, which encodes the
first-order information within a local neighborhood under the guidance of
spatially varying directional descriptors (i.e., orientation and the dose of
anisotropy). In order to estimate those descriptors, we propose an efficient
preprocessor that captures the local geometry based on the structure tensor.
Through the extensive experiments, we demonstrate how beneficial the
involvement of the directional information in STV is, by comparing the proposed
method with the state-of-the-art analysis-based denoising models, both in terms
of restoration quality and computational efficiency.",eess.IV,"cs.CV, eess.IV",2,Image and Video Processing,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Image and Video Processing",Mustafa E.

"Inferring Individual Level Causal Models from Graph-based Relational
  Time Series","In this work, we formalize the problem of causal inference over graph-based
relational time-series data where each node in the graph has one or more
time-series associated to it. We propose causal inference models for this
problem that leverage both the graph topology and time-series to accurately
estimate local causal effects of nodes. Furthermore, the relational time-series
causal inference models are able to estimate local effects for individual nodes
by exploiting local node-centric temporal dependencies and
topological/structural dependencies. We show that simpler causal models that do
not consider the graph topology are recovered as special cases of the proposed
relational time-series causal inference model. We describe the conditions under
which the resulting estimate can be used to estimate a causal effect, and
describe how the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test of specification can be used to test
for the consistency of the proposed estimator from data. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the causal inference models on both synthetic

"Provable Benefit of Orthogonal Initialization in Optimizing Deep Linear
  Networks","The selection of initial parameter values for gradient-based optimization of
deep neural networks is one of the most impactful hyperparameter choices in
deep learning systems, affecting both convergence times and model performance.
Yet despite significant empirical and theoretical analysis, relatively little
has been proved about the concrete effects of different initialization schemes.
In this work, we analyze the effect of initialization in deep linear networks,
and provide for the first time a rigorous proof that drawing the initial
weights from the orthogonal group speeds up convergence relative to the
standard Gaussian initialization with iid weights. We show that for deep
networks, the width needed for efficient convergence to a global minimum with
orthogonal initializations is independent of the depth, whereas the width
needed for efficient convergence with Gaussian initializations scales linearly
in the depth. Our results demonstrate how the benefits of a good initialization
can persist throughout learning, suggesting an explanation for the recent
empirical successes found by initializing very deep non-linear networks
according to the principle of dynamical isometry.",cs.LG,"cs.NE, cs.LG, math.OC, stat.ML",4,Machine Learning,"Neural and Evolutionary Computing, Machine Learning, Optimization and Control, Machine Learning",Jeffrey Pennington,"Wei Hu, Lechao Xiao, Jeffrey Pennington",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05992v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05992v1,2020-01-16

Cross-conformal e-prediction,"This note discusses a simple modification of cross-conformal prediction
inspired by recent work on e-values. The precursor of conformal prediction
developed in the 1990s by Gammerman, Vapnik, and Vovk was also based on
e-values and is called conformal e-prediction in this note. Replacing e-values
by p-values led to conformal prediction, which has important advantages over
conformal e-prediction without obvious disadvantages. The situation with

prediction validity is only an empirical fact (and can be broken with excessive

Reward Shaping for Reinforcement Learning with Omega-Regular Objectives,"Recently, successful approaches have been made to exploit good-for-MDPs
automata (B\""uchi automata with a restricted form of nondeterminism) for model
free reinforcement learning, a class of automata that subsumes good for games
automata and the most widespread class of limit deterministic automata. The
foundation of using these B\""uchi automata is that the B\""uchi condition can,
for good-for-MDP automata, be translated to reachability.
  The drawback of this translation is that the rewards are, on average, reaped
very late, which requires long episodes during the learning process. We devise
a new reward shaping approach that overcomes this issue. We show that the
resulting model is equivalent to a discounted payoff objective with a biased
discount that simplifies and improves on prior work in this direction.",cs.LO,"cs.LO, cs.LG",2,Logic in Computer Science,"Logic in Computer Science, Machine Learning",D. Wojtczak,"E. M. Hahn, M.

"Robust Topological Descriptors for Machine Learning Prediction of Guest
  Adsorption in Nanoporous Materials","In recent years, machine learning (ML) for predicting material properties has
emerged as a quicker alternative to experimental and simulation-based
investigations. Standard ML approaches tend to utilize specific domain
knowledge when designing feature inputs. Each ML property predictor then
requires a set of tailored structural features - this can commonly lead to
drawbacks, due to the small number of implemented features and their lack of
prediction transferability across different predictors. The latter has been
empirically observed in the case of guest uptake predictors for nanoporous
materials, where local and global porosity features become dominant descriptors
at low and high pressures, respectively. Here, we provide a more holistic
feature representation for materials structures using tools from topological
data analysis and persistent homology to describe the geometry and topology of
nanoporous materials at various scales. We demonstrate an application of these
topology-based feature representations to predict methane uptakes for zeolite
structures in the range of 1-200 bar. These predictions show a root-mean-square
deviation decrease of up to 50% at low pressures and up to 100% across high
pressures in comparison to a model based on commonly used local and global
features. Similarly, the topology-based model shows an increase of 0.2-0.3 in
R2 score in comparison to the commonly used porosity descriptors. Notably,
unlike the standard porosity features, the topology-based features show
accuracy across multiple different pressures. Furthermore, we show feature
importance in terms of different topological features, thus elucidating
information about the channel and pore sizes that correlate best to adsorption
properties. Finally, we demonstrate that ML models relying on a combination of
topological and commonly employed descriptors provide even better guest uptake
regressors.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG, math.AT",4,Materials Science,"Computational Physics, Materials Science, Machine Learning, Algebraic Topology",Dmitriy Morozov,"Aditi S.

Machine learning for total cloud cover prediction,"Accurate and reliable forecasting of total cloud cover (TCC) is vital for
many areas such as astronomy, energy demand and production, or agriculture.
Most meteorological centres issue ensemble forecasts of TCC, however, these
forecasts are often uncalibrated and exhibit worse forecast skill than ensemble
forecasts of other weather variables. Hence, some form of post-processing is
strongly required to improve predictive performance. As TCC observations are
usually reported on a discrete scale taking just nine different values called
oktas, statistical calibration of TCC ensemble forecasts can be considered a
classification problem with outputs given by the probabilities of the oktas.
This is a classical area where machine learning methods are applied. We
investigate the performance of post-processing using multilayer perceptron
(MLP) neural networks, gradient boosting machines (GBM) and random forest (RF)
methods. Based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global
TCC ensemble forecasts for 2002-2014 we compare these approaches with the
proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) and multiclass logistic regression
(MLR) models, as well as the raw TCC ensemble forecasts. We further assess
whether improvements in forecast skill can be obtained by incorporating
ensemble forecasts of precipitation as additional predictor. Compared to the
raw ensemble, all calibration methods result in a significant improvement in
forecast skill. RF models provide the smallest increase in predictive
performance, while MLP, POLR and GBM approaches perform best. The use of
precipitation forecast data leads to further improvements in forecast skill and
except for very short lead times the extended MLP model shows the best overall
performance.",stat.ML,"stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.AP",3,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Machine Learning, Applications",Sándor Baran,"Ágnes Baran, Sebastian Lerch, Mehrez El Ayari, Sándor Baran",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05948v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05948v1,2020-01-16
"Elastic Consistency: A General Consistency Model for Distributed
  Stochastic Gradient Descent","Machine learning has made tremendous progress in recent years, with models
matching or even surpassing humans on a series of specialized tasks. One key
element behind the progress of machine learning in recent years has been the
ability to train machine learning models in large-scale distributed
shared-memory and message-passing environments. Many of these models are
trained employing variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based
optimization.
  In this paper, we introduce a general consistency condition covering
communication-reduced and asynchronous distributed SGD implementations. Our
framework, called elastic consistency enables us to derive convergence bounds
for a variety of distributed SGD methods used in practice to train large-scale
machine learning models. The proposed framework de-clutters the
implementation-specific convergence analysis and provides an abstraction to
derive convergence bounds. We utilize the framework to analyze a sparsification
scheme for distributed SGD methods in an asynchronous setting for convex and
non-convex objectives. We implement the distributed SGD variant to train deep
CNN models in an asynchronous shared-memory setting. Empirical results show
that error-feedback may not necessarily help in improving the convergence of
sparsified asynchronous distributed SGD, which corroborates an insight
suggested by our convergence analysis.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, cs.LG",2,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Vyacheslav Kungurtsev,"Dan Alistarh, Bapi Chatterjee, Vyacheslav Kungurtsev",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05918v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05918v1,2020-01-16
Masking schemes for universal marginalisers,"We consider the effect of structure-agnostic and structure-dependent masking
schemes when training a universal marginaliser (arXiv:1711.00695) in order to
learn conditional distributions of the form $P(x_i |\mathbf x_{\mathbf b})$,
where $x_i$ is a given random variable and $\mathbf x_{\mathbf b}$ is some
arbitrary subset of all random variables of the generative model of interest.
In other words, we mimic the self-supervised training of a denoising
autoencoder, where a dataset of unlabelled data is used as partially observed
input and the neural approximator is optimised to minimise reconstruction loss.
We focus on studying the underlying process of the partially observed
data---how good is the neural approximator at learning all conditional
distributions when the observation process at prediction time differs from the
masking process during training? We compare networks trained with different
masking schemes in terms of their predictive performance and generalisation

A piecewise deterministic Monte Carlo method for diffusion bridges,"We introduce the use of the Zig-Zag sampler to the problem of sampling of
conditional diffusion processes (diffusion bridges). The Zig-Zag sampler is a
rejection-free sampling scheme based on a non-reversible continuous piecewise
deterministic Markov process. Similar to the L\'evy-Ciesielski construction of
a Brownian motion, we expand the diffusion path in a truncated Faber-Schauder
basis. The coefficients within the basis are sampled using a Zig-Zag sampler. A
key innovation is the use of a local version of the Zig-Zag sampler that allows
to exploit the sparse dependency structure of the coefficients of the
Faber-Schauder expansion to reduce the complexity of the algorithm. We
illustrate the performance of the proposed methods in a number of examples.
Contrary to some other Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, our approach works
well in case of strong nonlinearity in the drift and multimodal distributions
of sample paths.",math.ST,"math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH, stat.ME",4,Statistics Theory,"Probability, Statistics Theory, Statistics Theory, Methodology",Moritz Schauer,"Joris Bierkens, Sebastiano Grazzi, Frank van der Meulen, Moritz Schauer",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05889v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05889v1,2020-01-16

arbitrary finite rank. We propose a hypothesis test based on the linear
spectral statistics of the data matrix, which is optimal and does not depend on

"A sparse-grid probabilistic scheme for approximation of the runway
  probability of electrons in fusion tokamak simulation","Runaway electrons (RE) generated during magnetic disruptions present a major
threat to the safe operation of plasma nuclear fusion reactors. A critical
aspect of understanding RE dynamics is to calculate the runaway probability,
i.e., the probability that an electron in the phase space will runaway on, or
before, a prescribed time. Such probability can be obtained by solving the
adjoint equation of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation that controls the
electron dynamics. In this effort, we present a sparse-grid probabilistic
scheme for computing the runaway probability. The key ingredient of our
approach is to represent the solution of the adjoint equation as a conditional
expectation, such that discretizing the differential operator reduces to the
approximation of a set of integrals. Adaptive sparse grid interpolation is
utilized to approximate the map from the phase space to the runaway
probability. The main novelties of this effort are the integration of the
sparse-grid method into the probabilistic numerical scheme for computing escape
probability, as well as the demonstration in computing RE probabilities. Two
numerical examples are given to illustrate that the proposed method can achieve
$\mathcal{O}(\Delta t)$ convergence, as well as the adaptive refinement
strategy can effectively handle the sharp transition layer between the runaway
and non-runaway regions.",physics.comp-ph,"physics.comp-ph, physics.plasm-ph",2,Computational Physics,"Computational Physics, Plasma Physics",Matthew Beidler,"Minglei Yang, Guannan Zhang, Diego del-Castillo-Negrete, Miroslav Stoyanov, Matthew Beidler",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05800v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05800v1,2020-01-16
"On Solving Groundwater Flow and Transport Models with Algebraic
  Multigrid Preconditioning","Sparse iterative solvers preconditioned with the algebraic multigrid has been
devised as an optimal technology to speed up the response of large linear
systems. In this work, this technique was introduced into the framework of the
dual delineation approach. This involves a single groundwater flow solution and
a scalar advective transport solution with different right-hand sides. The
method was compared with traditional preconditioned iterative methods and a
direct sparse solver on several two- and three-dimensional benchmarks spanning
homogeneous and heterogeneous formations. The algebraic multigrid
preconditioning enabled speedups lying between one and two orders of magnitude
for the groundwater flow problems. However, the sparse direct solver was the
fastest for the pure advective transport processes such as the forward travel
time simulations. This leads to conclude that the best sparse solver for the
general advection-dispersion transport equation is P\'eclet number dependent.
When equipped with the best solvers, the dual delineation technique was run on
a took only a few seconds to solve multi-million grid cell problems paving the
way for comprehensive sensitivity analysis. The paper gives practical hints on
the strategies and conditions under which the algebraic multigrid
preconditioning for nonlinear and/or transient problems would remain
competitive.",physics.geo-ph,"physics.geo-ph, math.NA, cs.NA, physics.comp-ph",4,Geophysics,"Geophysics, Numerical Analysis, Numerical Analysis, Computational Physics",A. Larabi,"M. A. Sbai, A. Larabi",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05798v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05798v1,2020-01-16

of partial differential equations (PDEs) from measurement data. The first is a
regression-based Variational System Identification procedure that is
advantageous in not requiring repeated forward model solves and has good
scalability to large number of differential operators. However it has strict
data type requirements needing the ability to directly represent the operators
through the available data. The second is a Bayesian inference framework highly
valuable for providing uncertainty quantification, and flexible for
accommodating sparse and noisy data that may also be indirect quantities of

"The Widely Linear Complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process with Application to

widespread and found in many applications. However, existing models and
analysis techniques are usually restricted to signals observed in discrete
time. In this paper we introduce a widely linear version of the complex
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. This is a continuous-time process which
generalises the standard complex-valued OU process such that signals generated
from the process contain elliptical oscillations, as opposed to circular
oscillations, when viewed in the complex plane. We determine properties of the
widely linear complex OU process, including the conditions for stationarity,
and the geometrical structure of the elliptical oscillations. We derive the
analytical form of the power spectral density function, which then provides an
efficient procedure for parameter inference using the Whittle likelihood. We
apply the process to measure periodic and elliptical properties of Earth's
polar motion, including that of the Chandler wobble, for which the standard
complex OU process was originally proposed.",stat.ME,"astro-ph.EP, physics.data-an, stat.AP, stat.ME, eess.SP",5,Methodology,"Earth and Planetary Astrophysics, Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability, Applications, Methodology, Signal Processing",Hanna M.

"Flow Rate Estimation From Probe Vehicle Data And Sample Size
  Requirements","The interest to use probe vehicles for traffic monitoring is growing. This
paper is focused on the estimation of flow rate from probe vehicle data and the
evaluation of sample size requirements. Three cases are considered depending on
the available information on the percentage of probes p and the flow rate
\lambda: i) p is known but \lambda is unknown ii) \lambda is known but p is
unknown, and iii) both parameters are not known. Estimation methods for all
three cases are presented along with the reliability of these estimates. For
the first two cases, count data provide sufficient information to estimate the
unknown parameters p and \lambda individually when the other one is known. For
these two cases, simple analytical expressions are derived to analyze the
accuracy and sample size requirements. However, when both parameters are
unknown then additional information beyond count data is required. The position
of probe vehicles in a queue at signalized intersections is used as additional
information in that case. The results show for how long data need to be

presented for predicting the expected queue length and its variance based on
Negative Exponential and Bunched Exponential vehicle headways. Numerical
results for both vehicle headway types are documented to show how prediction

"Estimating and comparing adverse event probabilities in the presence of
  varying follow-up times and competing events","Safety analyses in terms of adverse events (AEs) are an important aspect of
benefit-risk assessments of therapies. Compared to efficacy analyses AE
analyses are often rather simplistic. The probability of an AE of a specific
type is typically estimated by the incidence proportion, sometimes the
incidence density or the Kaplan-Meier estimator are proposed. But these
analyses either do not account for censoring, rely on a too restrictive
parametric model, or ignore competing events. With the non-parametric
Aalen-Johansen estimator as the gold-standard, these potential sources of bias
are investigated in a data example from oncology and in simulations, both in
the one-sample and in the two-sample case. As the estimators may have large
variances at the end of follow-up, the estimators are not only compared at the
maximal event time but also at two quantiles of the observed times. To date,
consequences for safety comparisons have hardly been investigated in the
literature. The impact of using different estimators for group comparisons is
unclear, as, for example, the ratio of two both underestimating or
overestimating estimators may or may not be comparable to the ratio of the
gold-standard estimator. Therefore, the ratio of the AE probabilities is also
calculated based on different approaches. By simulations investigating constant
and non-constant hazards, different censoring mechanisms and event frequencies,
we show that ignoring competing events is more of a problem than falsely
assuming constant hazards by use of the incidence density and that the choice
of the AE probability estimator is crucial for group comparisons.",stat.AP,stat.AP,1,Applications,Applications,Jan Beyersmann,"Regina Stegherr, Claudia Schmoor, Michael Lübbert, Tim Friede, Jan Beyersmann",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05709v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05709v1,2020-01-16

according to a multiscale generalization of a large class of stick-breaking
processes; this multiscale stick-breaking is paired with specific stochastic
processes generating sequences of parameters that induce stochastically ordered
kernel functions. Properties of this family of multiscale stick-breaking
mixtures are described. Focusing on a Gaussian specification, a Markov Chain

Quantified limits of the nuclear landscape,"The chart of the nuclides is limited by particle drip lines beyond which
nuclear stability to proton or neutron emission is lost. Predicting the range
of particle-bound isotopes poses an appreciable challenge for nuclear theory as
it involves extreme extrapolations of nuclear masses beyond the regions where
experimental information is available. Still, quantified extrapolations are
crucial for a variety of applications, including the modeling of stellar
nucleosynthesis. We use microscopic nuclear mass models and Bayesian
methodology to provide quantified predictions of proton and neutron separation
energies as well as Bayesian probabilities of existence throughout the nuclear
landscape all the way to the particle drip lines. We apply nuclear density
functional theory with several energy density functionals. To account for
uncertainties, Bayesian Gaussian processes are trained on the separation-energy
residuals for each individual model, and the resulting predictions are combined
via Bayesian model averaging. This framework allows to account for systematic
and statistical uncertainties and propagate them to extrapolative predictions.
We characterize the drip-line regions where the probability that the nucleus is
particle-bound decreases from $1$ to $0$. In these regions, we provide
quantified predictions for one- and two-nucleon separation energies. According
to our Bayesian model averaging analysis, 7759 nuclei with $Z\leq 119$ have a
probability of existence $\geq 0.5$. The extrapolations obtained in this study
will be put through stringent tests when new experimental information on exotic
nuclei becomes available. In this respect, the quantified landscape of nuclear
existence obtained in this study should be viewed as a dynamical prediction
that will be fine-tuned when new experimental information and improved global
mass models become available.",nucl-th,"stat.ML, nucl-th, nucl-ex, 62F15, 62P35, 60G15",4,Nuclear Theory,"Machine Learning, Nuclear Theory, Nuclear Experiment",Oleg B.
