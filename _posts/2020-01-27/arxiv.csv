Towards a Framework for Certification of Reliable Autonomous Systems,"A computational system is called autonomous if it is able to make its own
decisions, or take its own actions, without human supervision or control. The
capability and spread of such systems have reached the point where they are
beginning to touch much of everyday life. However, regulators grapple with how
to deal with autonomous systems, for example how could we certify an Unmanned
Aerial System for autonomous use in civilian airspace? We here analyse what is
needed in order to provide verified reliable behaviour of an autonomous system,
analyse what can be done as the state-of-the-art in automated verification, and
propose a roadmap towards developing regulatory guidelines, including
articulating challenges to researchers, to engineers, and to regulators. Case
studies in seven distinct domains illustrate the article.",cs.SE,"cs.RO, cs.SE, cs.AI",3,Software Engineering,"Robotics, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence",Neil Yorke-Smith,"Michael Fisher, Viviana Mascardi, Kristin Yvonne Rozier, Bernd-Holger Schlingloff, Michael Winikoff, Neil Yorke-Smith",6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09124v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09124v1,2020-01-24
"Perception as prediction using general value functions in autonomous
  driving applications","We propose and demonstrate a framework called perception as prediction for
autonomous driving that uses general value functions (GVFs) to learn
predictions. Perception as prediction learns data-driven predictions relating
to the impact of actions on the agent's perception of the world. It also
provides a data-driven approach to predict the impact of the anticipated
behavior of other agents on the world without explicitly learning their policy
or intentions. We demonstrate perception as prediction by learning to predict
an agent's front safety and rear safety with GVFs, which encapsulate
anticipation of the behavior of the vehicle in front and in the rear,
respectively. The safety predictions are learned through random interactions in
a simulated environment containing other agents. We show that these predictions
can be used to produce similar control behavior to an LQR-based controller in
an adaptive cruise control problem as well as provide advanced warning when the
vehicle behind is approaching dangerously. The predictions are compact
policy-based predictions that support prediction of the long term impact on
safety when following a given policy. We analyze two controllers that use the
learned predictions in a racing simulator to understand the value of the
predictions and demonstrate their use in the real-world on a Clearpath Jackal
robot and an autonomous vehicle platform.",cs.RO,"cs.SY, cs.RO, cs.AI, eess.SY",4,Robotics,"Systems and Control, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence",Sean Scheideman,"Daniel Graves, Kasra Rezaee, Sean Scheideman",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09113v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09113v1,2020-01-24
Towards Graph Representation Learning in Emergent Communication,"Recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the human brain represents
information in a geometric structure (for instance, through conceptual spaces).
In order to communicate, we flatten the complex representation of entities and
their attributes into a single word or a sentence. In this paper we use graph
convolutional networks to support the evolution of language and cooperation in
multi-agent systems. Motivated by an image-based referential game, we propose a
graph referential game with varying degrees of complexity, and we provide
strong baseline models that exhibit desirable properties in terms of language
emergence and cooperation. We show that the emerged communication protocol is
robust, that the agents uncover the true factors of variation in the game, and
that they learn to generalize beyond the samples encountered during training.",cs.LG,"cs.MA, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML",4,Machine Learning,"Multiagent Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Sean B.

Theoretically Expressive and Edge-aware Graph Learning,"We propose a new Graph Neural Network that combines recent advancements in
the field. We give theoretical contributions by proving that the model is
strictly more general than the Graph Isomorphism Network and the Gated Graph
Neural Network, as it can approximate the same functions and deal with
arbitrary edge values. Then, we show how a single node information can flow
through the graph unchanged.",cs.LG,"cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML",3,Machine Learning,"Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Alessio Micheli,"Federico Errica, Davide Bacciu, Alessio Micheli",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09005v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09005v1,2020-01-24
Machine Understandable Policies and GDPR Compliance Checking,"The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) calls for technical
and organizational measures to support its implementation. Towards this end,
the SPECIAL H2020 project aims to provide a set of tools that can be used by
data controllers and processors to automatically check if personal data
processing and sharing complies with the obligations set forth in the GDPR. The
primary contributions of the project include: (i) a policy language that can be
used to express consent, business policies, and regulatory obligations; and
(ii) two different approaches to automated compliance checking that can be used
to demonstrate that data processing performed by data controllers / processors
complies with consent provided by data subjects, and business processes comply
with regulatory obligations set forth in the GDPR.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI",2,Computers and Society,"Computers and Society, Artificial Intelligence",Luigi Sauro,"Piero A.

On the Performance of Metaheuristics: A Different Perspective,"Nowadays, we are immersed in tens of newly-proposed evolutionary and
swam-intelligence metaheuristics, which makes it very difficult to choose a
proper one to be applied on a specific optimization problem at hand. On the
other hand, most of these metaheuristics are nothing but slightly modified
variants of the basic metaheuristics. For example, Differential Evolution (DE)
or Shuffled Frog Leaping (SFL) are just Genetic Algorithms (GA) with a
specialized operator or an extra local search, respectively. Therefore, what
comes to the mind is whether the behavior of such newly-proposed metaheuristics
can be investigated on the basis of studying the specifications and
characteristics of their ancestors. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation
study on some basic metaheuristics i.e. Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Teaching-Learning-Based
Optimization (TLBO), and Cuckoo Optimization algorithm (COA) is conducted,
which give us a deeper insight into the performance of them so that we will be
able to better estimate the performance and applicability of all other
variations originated from them. A large number of experiments have been
conducted on 20 different combinatorial optimization benchmark functions with
different characteristics, and the results reveal to us some fundamental
conclusions besides the following ranking order among these metaheuristics,
{ABC, PSO, TLBO, GA, COA} i.e. ABC and COA are the best and the worst methods
from the performance point of view, respectively. In addition, from the
convergence perspective, PSO and ABC have significant better convergence for
unimodal and multimodal functions, respectively, while GA and COA have
premature convergence to local optima in many cases needing alternative
mutation mechanisms to enhance diversification and global search.",cs.NE,"cs.NE, cs.AI",2,Neural and Evolutionary Computing,"Neural and Evolutionary Computing, Artificial Intelligence",Raouf Khayami,"Hamid Reza Boveiri, Raouf Khayami",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08928v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08928v1,2020-01-24
Exploration Based Language Learning for Text-Based Games,"This work presents an exploration and imitation-learning-based agent capable
of state-of-the-art performance in playing text-based computer games.
Text-based computer games describe their world to the player through natural
language and expect the player to interact with the game using text. These
games are of interest as they can be seen as a testbed for language
understanding, problem-solving, and language generation by artificial agents.
Moreover, they provide a learning environment in which these skills can be
acquired through interactions with an environment rather than using fixed
corpora. One aspect that makes these games particularly challenging for
learning agents is the combinatorially large action space. Existing methods for
solving text-based games are limited to games that are either very simple or
have an action space restricted to a predetermined set of admissible actions.
In this work, we propose to use the exploration approach of Go-Explore for
solving text-based games. More specifically, in an initial exploration phase,
we first extract trajectories with high rewards, after which we train a policy
to solve the game by imitating these trajectories. Our experiments show that
this approach outperforms existing solutions in solving text-based games, and
it is more sample efficient in terms of the number of interactions with the
environment. Moreover, we show that the learned policy can generalize better
than existing solutions to unseen games without using any restriction on the
action space.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2,Computation and Language,"Computation and Language, Artificial Intelligence",Gokhan Tur,"Andrea Madotto, Mahdi Namazifar, Joost Huizinga, Piero Molino, Adrien Ecoffet, Huaixiu Zheng, Alexandros Papangelis, Dian Yu, Chandra Khatri, Gokhan Tur",10,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08868v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08868v1,2020-01-24
"RatLesNetv2: A Fully Convolutional Network for Rodent Brain Lesion
  Segmentation","Segmentation of rodent brain lesions on magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a
time-consuming task with high inter- and intra-operator variability due to its
subjective nature. We present a three-dimensional fully convolutional neural
network (ConvNet) named RatLesNetv2 for segmenting rodent brain lesions. We
compare its performance with other ConvNets on an unusually large and
heterogeneous data set composed by 916 T2-weighted rat brain scans at nine
different lesion stages. RatLesNetv2 obtained similar to higher Dice
coefficients than the other ConvNets and it produced much more realistic and
compact segmentations with notably less holes and lower Hausdorff distance.
RatLesNetv2-derived segmentations also exceeded inter-rater agreement Dice
coefficients. Additionally, we show that training on disparate ground truths
leads to significantly different segmentations, and we study RatLesNetv2
generalization capability when optimizing for training sets of different sizes.

"A Branching and Merging Convolutional Network with Homogeneous Filter
  Capsules","We present a convolutional neural network design with additional branches
after certain convolutions so that we can extract features with differing
effective receptive fields and levels of abstraction. From each branch, we
transform each of the final filters into a pair of homogeneous vector capsules.
As the capsules are formed from entire filters, we refer to them as filter
capsules. We then compare three methods for merging the branches--merging with
equal weight and merging with learned weights, with two different weight
initialization strategies. This design, in combination with a domain-specific
set of randomly applied augmentation techniques, establishes a new state of the
art for the MNIST dataset with an accuracy of 99.84% for an ensemble of these
models, as well as establishing a new state of the art for a single model
(99.79% accurate). These accuracies were achieved with a 75% reduction in both
the number of parameters and the number of epochs of training relative to the
previously best performing capsule network on MNIST. All training was performed
using the Adam optimizer and experienced no overfitting.",cs.CV,"cs.CV, cs.LG",2,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Tatiana Kalganova,"Adam Byerly, Tatiana Kalganova",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09136v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09136v1,2020-01-24
TVR: A Large-Scale Dataset for Video-Subtitle Moment Retrieval,"We introduce a new multimodal retrieval task - TV show Retrieval (TVR), in
which a short video moment has to be localized from a large video (with
subtitle) corpus, given a natural language query. Different from previous
moment retrieval tasks dealing with videos only, TVR requires the system to
understand both the video and the associated subtitle text, making it a more
realistic task. To support the study of this new task, we have collected a
large-scale, high-quality dataset consisting of 108,965 queries on 21,793
videos from 6 TV shows of diverse genres, where each query is associated with a
tight temporal alignment. Strict qualification and post-annotation verification
tests are applied to ensure the quality of the collected data. We present
several baselines and a novel Cross-modal Moment Localization (XML) modular
network for this new dataset and task. The proposed XML model surpasses all
presented baselines by a large margin and with better efficiency, providing a
strong starting point for future work. Extensive analysis experiments also show
that incorporating both video and subtitle modules yields better performance
than either alone. Lastly, we have also collected additional descriptions for
each annotated moment in TVR to form a new multimodal captioning dataset with
262K captions, named the TV show Caption dataset (TVC). Here models need to
jointly use the video and subtitle to generate a caption description. Both
datasets are publicly available at https://tvr.cs.unc.edu",cs.CV,"cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.IR",3,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Computation and Language, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Retrieval",Mohit Bansal,"Jie Lei, Licheng Yu, Tamara L.

"SceneEncoder: Scene-Aware Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds with A
  Learnable Scene Descriptor","Besides local features, global information plays an essential role in
semantic segmentation, while recent works usually fail to explicitly extract
the meaningful global information and make full use of it. In this paper, we
propose a SceneEncoder module to impose a scene-aware guidance to enhance the
effect of global information. The module predicts a scene descriptor, which
learns to represent the categories of objects existing in the scene and
directly guides the point-level semantic segmentation through filtering out
categories not belonging to this scene. Additionally, to alleviate segmentation
noise in local region, we design a region similarity loss to propagate
distinguishing features to their own neighboring points with the same label,
leading to the enhancement of the distinguishing ability of point-wise
features. We integrate our methods into several prevailing networks and conduct
extensive experiments on benchmark datasets ScanNet and ShapeNet. Results show
that our methods greatly improve the performance of baselines and achieve
state-of-the-art performance.",cs.CV,cs.CV,1,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Lizhuang Ma,"Jiachen Xu, Jingyu Gong, Jie Zhou, Xin Tan, Yuan Xie, Lizhuang Ma",6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09087v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09087v1,2020-01-24
Deep Non-Line-of-Sight Reconstruction,"The recent years have seen a surge of interest in methods for imaging beyond
the direct line of sight. The most prominent techniques rely on time-resolved
optical impulse responses, obtained by illuminating a diffuse wall with an
ultrashort light pulse and observing multi-bounce indirect reflections with an
ultrafast time-resolved imager. Reconstruction of geometry from such data,
however, is a complex non-linear inverse problem that comes with substantial
computational demands. In this paper, we employ convolutional feed-forward
networks for solving the reconstruction problem efficiently while maintaining
good reconstruction quality. Specifically, we devise a tailored autoencoder
architecture, trained end-to-end, that maps transient images directly to a
depth map representation. Training is done using an efficient transient
renderer for diffuse three-bounce indirect light transport that enables the
quick generation of large amounts of training data for the network. We examine
the performance of our method on a variety of synthetic and experimental
datasets and its dependency on the choice of training data and augmentation
strategies, as well as architectural features. We demonstrate that our
feed-forward network, even though it is trained solely on synthetic data,
generalizes to measured data from SPAD sensors and is able to obtain results
that are competitive with model-based reconstruction methods.",cs.CV,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG",3,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Julian Iseringhausen,"Javier Grau Chopite, Matthias B.

Kernel of CycleGAN as a Principle homogeneous space,"Unpaired image-to-image translation has attracted significant interest due to
the invention of CycleGAN, a method which utilizes a combination of adversarial
and cycle consistency losses to avoid the need for paired data. It is known
that the CycleGAN problem might admit multiple solutions, and our goal in this
paper is to analyze the space of exact solutions and to give perturbation
bounds for approximate solutions. We show theoretically that the exact solution
space is invariant with respect to automorphisms of the underlying probability
spaces, and, furthermore, that the group of automorphisms acts freely and
transitively on the space of exact solutions. We examine the case of zero
`pure' CycleGAN loss first in its generality, and, subsequently, expand our
analysis to approximate solutions for `extended' CycleGAN loss where identity
loss term is included. In order to demonstrate that these results are
applicable, we show that under mild conditions nontrivial smooth automorphisms
exist. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that neural networks can
learn these automorphisms with unexpected and unwanted results. We conclude
that finding optimal solutions to the CycleGAN loss does not necessarily lead
to the envisioned result in image-to-image translation tasks and that
underlying hidden symmetries can render the result utterly useless.",cs.LG,"cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.ML",3,Machine Learning,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Jonas Teuwen,"Nikita Moriakov, Jonas Adler, Jonas Teuwen",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09061v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09061v1,2020-01-24
PDE-based Group Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks,"We present a PDE-based framework that generalizes Group equivariant
Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs). In this framework, a network layer is
seen as a set of PDE-solvers where the equation's geometrically meaningful
coefficients become the layer's trainable weights. Formulating our PDEs on
homogeneous spaces allows these networks to be designed with built-in
symmetries such as rotation equivariance instead of being restricted to just
translation equivariance as in traditional CNNs. Having all the desired
symmetries included in the design obviates the need to include them by means of
costly techniques such as data augmentation. Roto-translation equivariance for
image analysis applications is the example we will be using throughout the
paper.
  Our default PDE is solved by a combination of linear group convolutions and
non-linear morphological group convolutions. Just like for linear convolution a
morphological convolution is specified by a kernel and this kernel is what is
being optimized during the training process. We demonstrate how the common CNN
operations of max/min-pooling and ReLUs arise naturally from solving a PDE and
how they are subsumed by morphological convolutions.
  We present a proof-of-concept experiment to demonstrate the potential of this
framework in increasing the performance of deep learning based imaging
applications.",cs.LG,"math.DG, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.ML",4,Machine Learning,"Differential Geometry, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Remco Duits,"Bart Smets, Jim Portegies, Erik Bekkers, Remco Duits",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09046v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09046v1,2020-01-24
Discrete graphical models -- an optimization perspective,"This monograph is about discrete energy minimization for discrete graphical
models. It considers graphical models, or, more precisely, maximum a posteriori
inference for graphical models, purely as a combinatorial optimization problem.
Modeling, applications, probabilistic interpretations and many other aspects
are either ignored here or find their place in examples and remarks only. It
covers the integer linear programming formulation of the problem as well as its
linear programming, Lagrange and Lagrange decomposition-based relaxations. In
particular, it provides a detailed analysis of the polynomially solvable
acyclic and submodular problems, along with the corresponding exact
optimization methods. Major approximate methods, such as message passing and
graph cut techniques are also described and analyzed comprehensively. The
monograph can be useful for undergraduate and graduate students studying
optimization or graphical models, as well as for experts in optimization who
want to have a look into graphical models. To make the monograph suitable for
both categories of readers we explicitly separate the mathematical optimization
background chapters from those specific to graphical models.",math.OC,"cs.CV, math.OC, cs.DM",3,Optimization and Control,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Optimization and Control, Discrete Mathematics",Bogdan Savchynskyy,Bogdan Savchynskyy,1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09017v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09017v1,2020-01-24
SOLAR: Second-Order Loss and Attention for Image Retrieval,"Recent works in deep-learning have shown that utilising second-order
information is beneficial in many computer-vision related tasks. Second-order
information can be enforced both in the spatial context and the abstract
feature dimensions. In this work we explore two second order components. One is
focused on second-order spatial information to increase the performance of
image descriptors, both local and global. More specifically, it is used to
re-weight feature maps, and thus emphasise salient image locations that are
subsequently used for description. The second component is concerned with a
second-order similarity (SOS) loss, that we extend to global descriptors for
image retrieval, and is used to enhance the triplet loss with hard negative
mining. We validate our approach on two different tasks and three datasets for
image retrieval and patch matching. The results show that our second order
components bring significant performance improvements in both tasks and lead to
state of the art results across the benchmarks.",cs.CV,"cs.CV, cs.LG",2,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Krystian Mikolajczyk,"Tony Ng, Vassileios Balntas, Yurun Tian, Krystian Mikolajczyk",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08972v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08972v1,2020-01-24
"Unsupervised Learning Methods for Visual Place Recognition in Discretely
  and Continuously Changing Environments","Visual place recognition in changing environments is the problem of finding
matchings between two sets of observations, a query set and a reference set,
despite severe appearance changes. Recently, image comparison using CNN-based
descriptors showed very promising results. However, existing experiments from
the literature typically assume a single distinctive condition within each set
(e.g., reference: day, query: night). We demonstrate that as soon as the
conditions change within one set (e.g., reference: day, query: traversal
daytime-dusk-night-dawn), different places under the same condition can
suddenly look more similar than same places under different conditions and
state-of-the-art approaches like CNN-based descriptors fail. This paper
discusses this practically very important problem of in-sequence condition
changes and defines a hierarchy of problem setups from (1) no in-sequence
changes, (2) discrete in-sequence changes, to (3) continuous in-sequence
changes. We will experimentally evaluate the effect of these changes on two
state-of-the-art CNN-descriptors. Our experiments emphasize the importance of
statistical standardization of descriptors and shows its limitations in case of
continuous changes. To address this practically most relevant setup, we
investigate and experimentally evaluate the application of unsupervised
learning methods using two available PCA-based approaches and propose a novel
clustering-based extension of the statistical normalization.",cs.CV,"cs.RO, cs.CV",2,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Robotics, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",Peter Protzel,"Stefan Schubert, Peer Neubert, Peter Protzel",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08960v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08960v1,2020-01-24
"An Explicit Local and Global Representation Disentanglement Framework
  with Applications in Deep Clustering and Unsupervised Object Detection","There are several benefits from learning disentangled representations,
including interpretability, compositionality and generalisation to new tasks.
Disentanglement could be done by imposing an inductive bias based on prior
knowledge. Different priors make different structural assumptions about the
representations. For instance, priors with granularity can lead to
representation to describe data at different scales. A notable example is in
the visual domain where there are multiple scales of the variation in the data.
Hence, learning representation at different scales will be useful for different
tasks. In this work, we propose a framework, called SPLIT, which allows us to
disentangle local and global information into two separate sets of latent
variables within the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. Our framework
adds an extra generative assumption to the VAE by requiring a subset of the
latent variables to generate an auxiliary set of observable data. This set of
data, which contains only local information, can be obtained via a
transformation of the original data that removes global information. Three
different flavours of VAE with different generative assumptions were examined
in our experiments. We show that the framework can be effectively used to
disentangle local and global information within these models. Benefits of the
framework are demonstrated through multiple downstream representation learning
problems. The framework can unlock the potential of these VAE models in the
tasks of style transfer, deep clustering and unsupervised object detection with
a simple modification to existing VAE models. Finally, we review cognitive
neuroscience literature regarding disentanglement in human visual perception.

"Large-Scale Optical Reservoir Computing for Spatiotemporal Chaotic
  Systems Prediction","Reservoir computing is a relatively recent computational paradigm that
originates from a recurrent neural network, and is known for its wide-range of
implementations using different physical technologies. Large reservoirs are
very hard to obtain in conventional computers as both the computation
complexity and memory usage grows quadratically. We propose an optical scheme
performing reservoir computing over very large networks of up to $10^6$ fully
connected photonic nodes thanks to its intrinsic properties of parallelism. Our
experimental studies confirm that in contrast to conventional computers, the
computation time of our optical scheme is only linearly dependent on the number
of photonic nodes of the network, which is due to electronic overheads, while
the optical part of computation remains fully parallel and independent of the
reservoir size. To demonstrate the scalability of our optical scheme, we
perform for the first time predictions on large multidimensional chaotic
datasets using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation as an example of a
spatiotemporal chaotic system. Our results are extremely challenging for
conventional Turing-von Neumann machines, and they significantly advance the
state-of-the-art of unconventional reservoir computing approaches in general.",physics.optics,"physics.optics, cs.ET",2,Optics,"Optics, Emerging Technologies",Sylvain Gigan,"Mushegh Rafayelyan, Jonathan Dong, Yongqi Tan, Florent Krzakala, Sylvain Gigan",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09131v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09131v1,2020-01-24
"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Multiple Access with User
  Pairing: NOMA or OMA?","The integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to multiple access
networks is a cost-effective solution for boosting spectrum/energy efficiency
and enlarging network coverage/connections. However, due to the new capability
of IRS in reconfiguring the wireless propagation channels, it is fundamentally
unknown which multiple access scheme is superior in the IRS-assisted wireless
network. In this letter, we pursue a theoretical performance comparison between
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in
the IRS-assisted downlink communication, for which the transmit power
minimization problems are formulated under the discrete unit-modulus reflection
constraint on each IRS element. We analyze the minimum transmit powers required
by different multiple access schemes and compare them numerically, which turn
out to not fully comply with the stereotyped superiority of NOMA over OMA in
conventional systems without IRS. Moreover, to avoid the exponential complexity
of the brute-force search for the optimal discrete IRS phase shifts, we propose
a low-complexity solution to achieve near-optimal performance.",cs.IT,"math.IT, cs.IT, cs.ET",3,Information Theory,"Information Theory, Information Theory, Emerging Technologies",Rui Zhang,"Beixiong Zheng, Qingqing Wu, Rui Zhang",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08909v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08909v1,2020-01-24
Semi-supervised ASR by End-to-end Self-training,"While deep learning based end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems have greatly simplified modeling pipelines, they suffer from the data
sparsity issue. In this work, we propose a self-training method with an
end-to-end system for semi-supervised ASR. Starting from a Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC) system trained on the supervised data, we
iteratively generate pseudo-labels on a mini-batch of unsupervised utterances
with the current model, and use the pseudo-labels to augment the supervised
data for immediate model update. Our method retains the simplicity of
end-to-end ASR systems, and can be seen as performing alternating optimization
over a well-defined learning objective. We also perform empirical
investigations of our method, regarding the effect of data augmentation,
decoding beamsize for pseudo-label generation, and freshness of pseudo-labels.
On a commonly used semi-supervised ASR setting with the WSJ corpus, our method
gives 14.4% relative WER improvement over a carefully-trained base system with
data augmentation, reducing the performance gap between the base system and the
oracle system by 50%.",eess.AS,"cs.CL, eess.AS, cs.LG, cs.SD",4,Audio and Speech Processing,"Computation and Language, Audio and Speech Processing, Machine Learning, Sound",Chao Wang,"Yang Chen, Weiran Wang, Chao Wang",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09128v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09128v1,2020-01-24
"Performance of a Deep Neural Network at Detecting North Atlantic Right

North Atlantic right whale (NARW), but improved detection algorithms are needed
to handle diverse and variable acoustic conditions and differences in recording
techniques and equipment. Here, we investigate the potential of Deep Neural

examples recorded at various locations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2018 and
2019, using different equipment and deployment techniques. Used as a detection
algorithm on fifty 30-minute recordings from the years 2015-2017 containing
over one thousand upcalls, the network achieves recalls up to 80%, while
maintaining a precision of 90%. Importantly, the performance of the network
improves as more variance is introduced into the training dataset, whereas the
opposite trend is observed using a conventional linear discriminant analysis
approach. Our work demonstrates that Deep Neural Networks can be trained to
identify NARW upcalls under diverse and variable conditions with a performance
that compares favorably to that of existing algorithms.",eess.AS,"eess.AS, cs.LG, cs.SD",3,Audio and Speech Processing,"Audio and Speech Processing, Machine Learning, Sound",Samuel Giard,"Oliver S.

Reasoning About Generalization via Conditional Mutual Information,"We provide an information-theoretic framework for studying the generalization
properties of machine learning algorithms. Our framework ties together existing
approaches, including uniform convergence bounds and recent methods for
adaptive data analysis. Specifically, we use Conditional Mutual Information
(CMI) to quantify how well the input (i.e., the training data) can be
recognized given the output (i.e., the trained model) of the learning
algorithm. We show that bounds on CMI can be obtained from VC dimension,
compression schemes, differential privacy, and other methods. We then show that
bounded CMI implies various forms of generalization.",cs.LG,"cs.LG, cs.IT, cs.CR, cs.DS, math.IT, stat.ML",6,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Information Theory, Cryptography and Security, Data Structures and Algorithms, Information Theory, Machine Learning",Lydia Zakynthinou,"Thomas Steinke, Lydia Zakynthinou",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09122v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09122v1,2020-01-24

Effectively Trainable Semi-Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machine,"We propose a novel quantum model for the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM),
in which the visible units remain classical whereas the hidden units are
quantized as noninteracting fermions. The free motion of the fermions is
parametrically coupled to the classical signal of the visible units. This model
possesses a quantum behaviour such as coherences between the hidden units.
Numerical experiments show that this fact makes it more powerful than the
classical RBM with the same number of hidden units. At the same time, a
significant advantage of the proposed model over the other approaches to the
Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) is that it is exactly solvable and efficiently
trainable on a classical computer: there is a closed expression for the
log-likelihood gradient with respect to its parameters. This fact makes it
interesting not only as a model of a hypothetical quantum simulator, but also
as a quantum-inspired classical machine-learning algorithm.",cond-mat.dis-nn,"cs.LG, cond-mat.dis-nn, stat.ML",3,Disordered Systems and Neural Networks,"Machine Learning, Disordered Systems and Neural Networks, Machine Learning",A.

Learning to Catch Security Patches,"Timely patching is paramount to safeguard users and maintainers against dire
consequences of malicious attacks. In practice, patching is prioritized
following the nature of the code change that is committed in the code
repository. When such a change is labeled as being security-relevant, i.e., as
fixing a vulnerability, maintainers rapidly spread the change and users are
notified about the need to update to a new version of the library or of the
application. Unfortunately, oftentimes, some security-relevant changes go
unnoticed as they represent silent fixes of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we
propose a Co-Training-based approach to catch security patches as part of an
automatic monitoring service of code repositories. Leveraging different classes
of features, we empirically show that such automation is feasible and can yield
a precision of over 90% in identifying security patches, with an unprecedented
recall of over 80%. Beyond such a benchmarking with ground truth data which
demonstrates an improvement over the state-of-the-art, we confirmed that our
approach can help catch security patches that were not reported as such.",cs.SE,cs.SE,1,Software Engineering,Software Engineering,Yves Le Traon,"Arthur D. Sawadogo, TegawendÃ© F.

Optimal Design for Probit Choice Models with Dependent Utilities,"In this paper we derive locally D-optimal designs for discrete choice
experiments based on multinomial probit models. These models include several
discrete explanatory variables as well as a quantitative one. The commonly used
multinomial logit model assumes independent utilities for different choice
options. Thus, D-optimal optimal designs for such multinomial logit models may
comprise choice sets, e.g., consisting of alternatives which are identical in
all discrete attributes but different in the quantitative variable. Obviously
such designs are not appropriate for many empirical choice experiments. It will
be shown that locally D-optimal designs for multinomial probit models supposing
independent utilities consist of counterintuitive choice sets as well. However,
locally D-optimal designs for multinomial probit models allowing for dependent
utilities turn out to be reasonable for analyzing decisions using discrete
choice studies.",stat.ME,"stat.TH, math.ST, 62K05, 62J12, 62P15, stat.ME",4,Methodology,"Statistics Theory, Statistics Theory, Methodology",Rainer Schwabe,"Ulrike GraÃŸhoff, Heiko GroÃŸmann, Heinz Holling, Rainer Schwabe",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09036v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09036v1,2020-01-24
"Distributed Gaussian Mean Estimation under Communication Constraints:
  Optimal Rates and Communication-Efficient Algorithms","We study distributed estimation of a Gaussian mean under communication
constraints in a decision theoretical framework. Minimax rates of convergence,
which characterize the tradeoff between the communication costs and statistical
accuracy, are established in both the univariate and multivariate settings.
Communication-efficient and statistically optimal procedures are developed. In
the univariate case, the optimal rate depends only on the total communication
budget, so long as each local machine has at least one bit. However, in the
multivariate case, the minimax rate depends on the specific allocations of the
communication budgets among the local machines.
  Although optimal estimation of a Gaussian mean is relatively simple in the
conventional setting, it is quite involved under the communication constraints,
both in terms of the optimal procedure design and lower bound argument. The
techniques developed in this paper can be of independent interest. An essential
step is the decomposition of the minimax estimation problem into two stages,
localization and refinement. This critical decomposition provides a framework
for both the lower bound analysis and optimal procedure design.",math.ST,"cs.LG, stat.TH, cs.IT, math.ST, cs.DC, math.IT",6,Statistics Theory,"Machine Learning, Statistics Theory, Information Theory, Statistics Theory, Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing, Information Theory",Hongji Wei,"T.

"Arcsine laws for random walks generated from random permutations with

that the number of steps above the origin, the time of the last visit to the
origin, and the time of the maximum height all have exactly the same
distribution and converge when scaled to the arcsine law. Motivated by
applications in genomics, we study the distributions of these statistics for
the non-Markovian random walk generated from the ascents and descents of a
uniform random permutation and a Mallows($q$) permutation and show that they
have the same asymptotic distributions as for the simple random walk. We also
give an unexpected conjecture, along with numerical evidence and a partial
proof in special cases, for the result that the number of steps above the
origin by step $2n$ for the uniform permutation generated walk has exactly the
same discrete arcsine distribution as for the simple random walk, even though
the other statistics for these walks have very different laws. We also give
explicit error bounds to the limit theorems using Stein's method for the
arcsine distribution, as well as functional central limit theorems and a strong
embedding of the Mallows$(q)$ permutation which is of independent interest.",math.PR,"stat.TH, 60C05, 60J65, 05A05, math.ST, math.PR",4,Probability,"Statistics Theory, Statistics Theory, Probability",Wenpin Tang,"Xiao Fang, Han Liang Gan, Susan Holmes, Haiyan Huang, Erol PekÃ¶z, Adrian RÃ¶llin, Wenpin Tang",7,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08857v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08857v1,2020-01-24

energy resulting in a net lowering of zero-point energy. This is because
surface plasmon eigenvalues are the square of frequencies, a statement
generally true for electromagnetic excitations. We utilize the method based on
conformal mapping to demonstrate asymmetric splitting under surface
corrugations leading to a decrease in zero-point energy of a single corrugated

Impact of surface roughness in nanogap plasmonic systems,"Recent results have shown unprecedented control over separation distances
between two metallic elements hundreds of nanometers in size, underlying the
effects of free-electron nonlocal response also at mid-infrared wavelengths.
Most of metallic systems however, still suffer from some degree of
inhomogeneity due to fabrication-induced surface roughness. Nanoscale roughness
in such systems might hinder the understanding of the role of microscopic
interactions. Here we investigate the effect of surface roughness in coaxial
nanoapertures resonating at mid-infrared frequencies. We show that although
random roughness shifts the resonances in an unpredictable way, the impact of
nonlocal effects can still be clearly observed. Roughness-induced perturbation
on the peak resonance of the system shows a strong correlation with the
effective gap size of the individual samples. Fluctuations due to fabrication
imperfections then can be suppressed by performing measurements on structure
ensembles in which averaging over a large number of samples provides a precise
measure of the ideal system's optical properties.",physics.optics,"physics.optics, physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall",3,Optics,"Optics, Computational Physics, Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics",David R.

"First-principle calculation of Chern number in gyrotropic photonic

behaviors of the wavefunction, Chern number is the topological invariant of
quantum Hall insulators. Chern number also identifies the topological
properties of the photonic topological insulators (PTIs), thus it is of crucial
importance in PTI design. In this paper, we develop a first principle
computatioal method for the Chern number of 2D gyrotropic photonic crystals
(PCs), starting from the Maxwell's equations. Firstly, we solve the Hermitian
generalized eigenvalue equation reformulated from the Maxwell's equations by
using the full-wave finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method. Then the
Chern number is obtained by calculating the integral of Berry curvature over
the first Brillouin zone. Numerical examples of both transverse-electric (TE)

"Determination of Glass Transition Temperature of Polyimides from
  Atomistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Machine-Learning Algorithms","Glass transition temperature ($T_{\text{g}}$) plays an important role in
controlling the mechanical and thermal properties of a polymer. Polyimides are
an important category of polymers with wide applications because of their
superior heat resistance and mechanical strength. The capability of predicting
$T_{\text{g}}$ for a polyimide $a~priori$ is therefore highly desirable in
order to expedite the design and discovery of new polyimide polymers with
targeted properties and applications. Here we explore three different
approaches to either compute $T_{\text{g}}$ for a polyimide via all-atom
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or predict $T_{\text{g}}$ via a
mathematical model generated by using machine-learning algorithms to analyze
existing data collected from literature. Our simulations reveal that
$T_{\text{g}}$ can be determined from examining the diffusion coefficient of
simple gas molecules in a polyimide as a function of temperature and the
results are comparable to those derived from data on polymer density versus
temperature and actually closer to the available experimental data.
Furthermore, the predictive model of $T_{\text{g}}$ derived with
machine-learning algorithms can be used to estimate $T_{\text{g}}$ successfully
within an uncertainty of about 20 degrees, even for polyimides yet to be
synthesized experimentally.",physics.comp-ph,"cond-mat.soft, physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci",3,Computational Physics,"Soft Condensed Matter, Computational Physics, Materials Science",Shengfeng Cheng,"Chengyuan Wen, Binghan Liu, Josh Wolfgang, Timothy E.

Forecasting football matches by predicting match statistics,"This paper considers the use of observed and predicted match statistics as
inputs to forecasts of the outcomes of football matches. It is shown that, were
it possible to know the match statistics in advance, highly informative
forecasts of the match outcome could be made. Whilst, in practice, match
statistics are never available prior to the match, this leads to a simple
philosophy. If match statistics can be predicted pre-match, and if those
predictions are accurate enough, it follows that informative match forecasts
can be made. It is shown that Generalised Attacking Performance (GAP) ratings,
introduced in a recent paper, provide a suitable methodology for predicting
match statistics in advance and that they are informative enough to provide
information beyond that reflected in the odds. A long term and robust gambling
profit is demonstrated when the forecasts are combined with two betting

"Confounder selection strategies targeting stable treatment effect
  estimators","Propensity score methods are widely adopted in observational studies to
adjust for observed baseline confounding when either testing the null
hypothesis that treatment (or exposure) has no effect on an outcome or
estimating the causal effect. However, adjusting for all observed baseline
covariates, when only a subset are confounders of the treatment-outcome
relation, is known to yield potentially inefficient and unstable estimators of
the treatment effect. Similarly, randomization-based procedures that condition
on all observed covariates can be underpowered. For these stated reasons,
confounder (or covariate) selection is commonly used to determine a subset of
the available covariates that is sufficient for confounding adjustment. In this
article, we propose a confounder selection strategy that focuses on stable
estimation of the treatment effect. In particular, when the propensity score
model already includes covariates that are sufficient to adjust for
confounding, then the addition of covariates that are associated with either
treatment or outcome alone, but not both, should not systematically change the
effect estimator. The proposal, therefore, entails first prioritizing
covariates for inclusion in the propensity score model, then using a
change-in-estimate approach to select the smallest adjustment set that yields a
stable effect estimate. The ability of the proposal to correctly select
confounders, and to ensure valid inference of the treatment effect following
data-driven covariate selection, is assessed empirically and compared with
existing methods using simulation studies. We demonstrate the procedure using
three different publicly available datasets commonly used for causal inference.",stat.ME,stat.ME,1,Methodology,Methodology,Stijn Vansteelandt,"Wen Wei Loh, Stijn Vansteelandt",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08971v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08971v1,2020-01-24

Sparse Semi-supervised Heterogeneous Interbattery Bayesian Analysis,"The Bayesian approach to feature extraction, known as factor analysis (FA),

PoWER-BERT: Accelerating BERT inference for Classification Tasks,"BERT has emerged as a popular model for natural language understanding. Given
its compute intensive nature, even for inference, many recent studies have
considered optimization of two important performance characteristics: model
size and inference time. We consider classification tasks and propose a novel
method, called PoWER-BERT, for improving the inference time for the BERT model
without significant loss in the accuracy. The method works by eliminating
word-vectors (intermediate vector outputs) from the encoder pipeline. We design
a strategy for measuring the significance of the word-vectors based on the
self-attention mechanism of the encoders which helps us identify the
word-vectors to be eliminated. Experimental evaluation on the standard GLUE
benchmark shows that PoWER-BERT achieves up to 4.5x reduction in inference time
over BERT with < 1% loss in accuracy. We show that compared to the prior
inference time reduction methods, PoWER-BERT offers better trade-off between
accuracy and inference time. Lastly, we demonstrate that our scheme can also be
used in conjunction with ALBERT (a highly compressed version of BERT) and can
attain up to 6.8x factor reduction in inference time with < 1% loss in
accuracy.",cs.LG,"cs.CL, cs.LG, stat.ML",3,Machine Learning,"Computation and Language, Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Ashish Verma,"Saurabh Goyal, Anamitra Roy Choudhary, Venkatesan Chakaravarthy, Saurabh ManishRaje, Yogish Sabharwal, Ashish Verma",6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08950v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08950v1,2020-01-24
