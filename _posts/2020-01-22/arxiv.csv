"Intelligent Bandwidth Allocation for Latency Management in NG-EPON using
  Reinforcement Learning Methods","A novel intelligent bandwidth allocation scheme in NG-EPON using
reinforcement learning is proposed and demonstrated for latency management. We
verify the capability of the proposed scheme under both fixed and dynamic
traffic loads scenarios to achieve <1ms average latency. The RL agent
demonstrates an efficient intelligent mechanism to manage the latency, which
provides a promising IBA solution for the next-generation access network.",cs.NI,"eess.SP, cs.LG, cs.NI",3,Networking and Internet Architecture,"Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Networking and Internet Architecture",Gee-Kung Chang,"Qi Zhou, Jingjie Zhu, Junwen Zhang, Zhensheng Jia, Bernardo Huberman, Gee-Kung Chang",6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07698v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07698v1,2020-01-21
Stochastic Finite State Control of POMDPs with LTL Specifications,"Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a modeling
framework for autonomous decision making under uncertainty and imperfect
sensing, e.g. robot manipulation and self-driving cars. However, optimal
control of POMDPs is notoriously intractable. This paper considers the
quantitative problem of synthesizing sub-optimal stochastic finite state
controllers (sFSCs) for POMDPs such that the probability of satisfying a set of
high-level specifications in terms of linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae is
maximized. We begin by casting the latter problem into an optimization and use
relaxations based on the Poisson equation and McCormick envelopes. Then, we
propose an stochastic bounded policy iteration algorithm, leading to a
controlled growth in sFSC size and an any time algorithm, where the performance
of the controller improves with successive iterations, but can be stopped by
the user based on time or memory considerations. We illustrate the proposed
method by a robot navigation case study.",cs.AI,"cs.RO, eess.SY, cs.FL, cs.SY, math.OC, cs.AI",6,Artificial Intelligence,"Robotics, Formal Languages and Automata Theory, Systems and Control, Optimization and Control, Artificial Intelligence",Joel W.

Deceptive AI Explanations: Creation and Detection,"Artificial intelligence comes with great opportunities and but also great
risks. We investigate to what extent deep learning can be used to create and
detect deceptive explanations that either aim to lure a human into believing a
decision that is not truthful to the model or provide reasoning that is
non-faithful to the decision. Our theoretical insights show some limits of
deception and detection in the absence of domain knowledge. For empirical
evaluation, we focus on text classification. To create deceptive explanations,
we alter explanations originating from GradCAM, a state-of-art technique for
creating explanations in neural networks. We evaluate the effectiveness of
deceptive explanations on 200 participants. Our findings indicate that
deceptive explanations can indeed fool humans. Our classifier can detect even
seemingly minor attempts of deception with accuracy that exceeds 80\% given
sufficient domain knowledge encoded in the form of training data.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG",3,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning",Christian Meske,"Johannes Schneider, Joshua Handali, Michalis Vlachos, Christian Meske",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07641v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07641v1,2020-01-21
"Improving Interaction Quality Estimation with BiLSTMs and the Impact on
  Dialogue Policy Learning","Learning suitable and well-performing dialogue behaviour in statistical
spoken dialogue systems has been in the focus of research for many years. While
most work which is based on reinforcement learning employs an objective measure
like task success for modelling the reward signal, we use a reward based on
user satisfaction estimation. We propose a novel estimator and show that it
outperforms all previous estimators while learning temporal dependencies
implicitly. Furthermore, we apply this novel user satisfaction estimation model
live in simulated experiments where the satisfaction estimation model is
trained on one domain and applied in many other domains which cover a similar
task. We show that applying this model results in higher estimated
satisfaction, similar task success rates and a higher robustness to noise.",cs.CL,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.CL",3,Computation and Language,"Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computation and Language",Stefan Ultes,Stefan Ultes,1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07615v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07615v1,2020-01-21
Turing analogues of Gödel statements and computability of intelligence,"We show that there is a mathematical obstruction to complete Turing
computability of intelligence. This obstruction can be circumvented only if
human reasoning is fundamentally unsound. The most compelling original argument
for existence of such an obstruction was proposed by Penrose, however G\""odel,
Turing and Lucas have also proposed such arguments. We first partially
reformulate the argument of Penrose. In this formulation we argue that his
argument works up to possibility of construction of a certain G\""odel
statement. We then completely re-frame the argument in the language of Turing
machines, and by partially defining our subject just enough, we show that a
certain analogue of a G\""odel statement, or a G\""odel string as we call it in
the language of Turing machines, can be readily constructed directly, without
appeal to the G\""odel incompleteness theorem, and thus removing the final
objection.",cs.LO,"cs.LO, cs.AI",2,Logic in Computer Science,"Logic in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Yasha Savelyev,Yasha Savelyev,1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07592v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07592v1,2020-01-21
Adequate and fair explanations,"Explaining sophisticated machine-learning based systems is an important issue
at the foundations of AI. Recent efforts have shown various methods for
providing explanations. These approaches can be broadly divided into two
schools: those that provide a local and human interpreatable approximation of a
machine learning algorithm, and logical approaches that exactly characterise
one aspect of the decision. In this paper we focus upon the second school of
exact explanations with a rigorous logical foundation. There is an
epistemological problem with these exact methods. While they can furnish
complete explanations, such explanations may be too complex for humans to
understand or even to write down in human readable form. Interpretability
requires epistemically accessible explanations, explanations humans can grasp.
Yet what is a sufficiently complete epistemically accessible explanation still
needs clarification. We do this here in terms of counterfactuals, following
[Wachter et al., 2017]. With counterfactual explanations, many of the
assumptions needed to provide a complete explanation are left implicit. To do
so, counterfactual explanations exploit the properties of a particular data
point or sample, and as such are also local as well as partial explanations. We
explore how to move from local partial explanations to what we call complete
local explanations and then to global ones. But to preserve accessibility we
argue for the need for partiality. This partiality makes it possible to hide
explicit biases present in the algorithm that may be injurious or unfair.We
investigate how easy it is to uncover these biases in providing complete and
fair explanations by exploiting the structure of the set of counterfactuals
providing a complete local explanation.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, I.2.0",2,Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence,Chris Russell,"Nicholas Asher, Soumya Paul, Chris Russell",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07578v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07578v1,2020-01-21
Implementations in Machine Ethics: A Survey,"Increasingly complex and autonomous systems require machine ethics to
maximize the benefits and minimize the risks to society arising from the new
technology. It is challenging to decide which type of ethical theory to employ
and how to implement it effectively. This survey provides a threefold
contribution. Firstly, it introduces a taxonomy to analyze the field of machine
ethics from an ethical, implementational, and technical perspective. Secondly,
an exhaustive selection and description of relevant works is presented.
Thirdly, applying the new taxonomy to the selected works, dominant research
patterns and lessons for the field are identified, and future directions for
research are suggested.",cs.AI,cs.AI,1,Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence,Abraham Bernstein,"Suzanne Tolmeijer, Markus Kneer, Cristina Sarasua, Markus Christen, Abraham Bernstein",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07573v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07573v1,2020-01-21
Provenance for the Description Logic ELHr,"We address the problem of handling provenance information in ELHr ontologies.
We consider a setting recently introduced for ontology-based data access, based
on semirings and extending classical data provenance, in which ontology axioms
are annotated with provenance tokens. A consequence inherits the provenance of
the axioms involved in deriving it, yielding a provenance polynomial as an
annotation. We analyse the semantics for the ELHr case and show that the
presence of conjunctions poses various difficulties for handling provenance,
some of which are mitigated by assuming multiplicative idempotency of the
semiring. Under this assumption, we study three problems: ontology completion
with provenance, computing the set of relevant axioms for a consequence, and
query answering.",cs.LO,"cs.LO, cs.AI, 16Y60",3,Logic in Computer Science,"Logic in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Livia Predoiu,"Camille Bourgaux, Ana Ozaki, Rafael Peñaloza, Livia Predoiu",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07541v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07541v1,2020-01-21
AI Trust in business processes: The need for process-aware explanations,"Business processes underpin a large number of enterprise operations including
processing loan applications, managing invoices, and insurance claims. There is
a large opportunity for infusing AI to reduce cost or provide better customer
experience, and the business process management (BPM) literature is rich in
machine learning solutions including unsupervised learning to gain insights on
clusters of process traces, classification models to predict the outcomes,
duration, or paths of partial process traces, extracting business process from
documents, and models to recommend how to optimize a business process or
navigate decision points. More recently, deep learning models including those
from the NLP domain have been applied to process predictions.
  Unfortunately, very little of these innovations have been applied and adopted
by enterprise companies. We assert that a large reason for the lack of adoption
of AI models in BPM is that business users are risk-averse and do not
implicitly trust AI models. There has, unfortunately, been little attention
paid to explaining model predictions to business users with process context. We
challenge the BPM community to build on the AI interpretability literature, and
the AI Trust community to understand",cs.AI,cs.AI,1,Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence,Vinod Muthusamy,"Steve T. K. Jan, Vatche Ishakian, Vinod Muthusamy",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07537v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07537v1,2020-01-21
Domain-Aware Dialogue State Tracker for Multi-Domain Dialogue Systems,"In task-oriented dialogue systems the dialogue state tracker (DST) component
is responsible for predicting the state of the dialogue based on the dialogue
history. Current DST approaches rely on a predefined domain ontology, a fact
that limits their effective usage for large scale conversational agents, where
the DST constantly needs to be interfaced with ever-increasing services and
APIs. Focused towards overcoming this drawback, we propose a domain-aware
dialogue state tracker, that is completely data-driven and it is modeled to
predict for dynamic service schemas. The proposed model utilizes domain and
slot information to extract both domain and slot specific representations for a
given dialogue, and then uses such representations to predict the values of the
corresponding slot. Integrating this mechanism with a pretrained language model
(i.e. BERT), our approach can effectively learn semantic relations.",cs.CL,"cs.AI, cs.CL",2,Computation and Language,"Artificial Intelligence, Computation and Language",Bernardo Magnini,"Vevake Balaraman, Bernardo Magnini",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07526v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07526v1,2020-01-21
"Combining Federated and Active Learning for Communication-efficient
  Distributed Failure Prediction in Aeronautics","Machine Learning has proven useful in the recent years as a way to achieve
failure prediction for industrial systems. However, the high computational
resources necessary to run learning algorithms are an obstacle to its
widespread application. The sub-field of Distributed Learning offers a solution
to this problem by enabling the use of remote resources but at the expense of
introducing communication costs in the application that are not always
acceptable. In this paper, we propose a distributed learning approach able to
optimize the use of computational and communication resources to achieve
excellent learning model performances through a centralized architecture. To
achieve this, we present a new centralized distributed learning algorithm that
relies on the learning paradigms of Active Learning and Federated Learning to
offer a communication-efficient method that offers guarantees of model
precision on both the clients and the central server. We evaluate this method
on a public benchmark and show that its performances in terms of precision are
very close to state-of-the-art performance level of non-distributed learning
despite additional constraints.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.DC",2,Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence, Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",Yohan Petetin,"Nicolas Aussel, Sophie Chabridon, Yohan Petetin",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07504v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07504v1,2020-01-21
Unsupervisedly Learned Representations: Should the Quest be Over?,"There exists a Classification accuracy gap of about 20% between our best
methods of generating Unsupervisedly Learned Representations and the accuracy
rates achieved by (naturally Unsupervisedly Learning) humans. We are at our
fourth decade at least in search of this class of paradigms. It thus may well
be that we are looking in the wrong direction. We present in this paper a
possible solution to this puzzle. We demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning
schemes can learn representations, which may be used for Pattern Recognition
tasks such as Classification, achieving practically the same accuracy as that
of humans. Our main modest contribution lies in the observations that: a. when
applied to a real world environment (e.g. nature itself) Reinforcement Learning
does not require labels, and thus may be considered a natural candidate for the
long sought, accuracy competitive Unsupervised Learning method, and b. in
contrast, when Reinforcement Learning is applied in a simulated or symbolic
processing environment (e.g. a computer program) it does inherently require
labels and should thus be generally classified, with some exceptions, as
Supervised Learning. The corollary of these observations is that further search
for Unsupervised Learning competitive paradigms which may be trained in
simulated environments like many of those found in research and applications
may be futile.",cs.LG,"cs.AI, cs.LG",2,Machine Learning,"Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning",Daniel N. Nissani,Daniel N. Nissani,1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07495v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07495v1,2020-01-21
Fast Sequence-Based Embedding with Diffusion Graphs,"A graph embedding is a representation of graph vertices in a low-dimensional
space, which approximately preserves properties such as distances between
nodes. Vertex sequence-based embedding procedures use features extracted from
linear sequences of nodes to create embeddings using a neural network. In this
paper, we propose diffusion graphs as a method to rapidly generate vertex
sequences for network embedding. Its computational efficiency is superior to
previous methods due to simpler sequence generation, and it produces more
accurate results. In experiments, we found that the performance relative to
other methods improves with increasing edge density in the graph. In a
community detection task, clustering nodes in the embedding space produces
better results compared to other sequence-based embedding methods.",cs.LG,"cs.SI, cs.DC, stat.ML, cs.LG",4,Machine Learning,"Social and Information Networks, Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing, Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Rik Sarkar,"Benedek Rozemberczki, Rik Sarkar",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07463v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07463v1,2020-01-21
Designing for the Long Tail of Machine Learning,"Recent technical advances has made machine learning (ML) a promising
component to include in end user facing systems. However, user experience (UX)
practitioners face challenges in relating ML to existing user-centered design
processes and how to navigate the possibilities and constraints of this design
space. Drawing on our own experience, we characterize designing within this
space as navigating trade-offs between data gathering, model development and
designing valuable interactions for a given model performance. We suggest that
the theoretical description of how machine learning performance scales with
training data can guide designers in these trade-offs as well as having
implications for prototyping. We exemplify the learning curve's usage by
arguing that a useful pattern is to design an initial system in a bootstrap
phase that aims to exploit the training effect of data collected at increasing
orders of magnitude.",cs.HC,"cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG",3,Human-Computer Interaction,"Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning",Jesper Molin,"Martin Lindvall, Jesper Molin",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07455v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07455v1,2020-01-21
"Learning Diverse Features with Part-Level Resolution for Person
  Re-Identification","Learning diverse features is key to the success of person re-identification.
Various part-based methods have been extensively proposed for learning local
representations, which, however, are still inferior to the best-performing
methods for person re-identification. This paper proposes to construct a strong
lightweight network architecture, termed PLR-OSNet, based on the idea of
Part-Level feature Resolution over the Omni-Scale Network (OSNet) for achieving
feature diversity. The proposed PLR-OSNet has two branches, one branch for
global feature representation and the other branch for local feature
representation. The local branch employs a uniform partition strategy for
part-level feature resolution but produces only a single identity-prediction
loss, which is in sharp contrast to the existing part-based methods. Empirical
evidence demonstrates that the proposed PLR-OSNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance on popular person Re-ID datasets, including Market1501,
DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03, despite its small model size.",cs.CV,"cs.CV, cs.LG",2,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Ming Li,"Ben Xie, Xiaofu Wu, Suofei Zhang, Shiliang Zhao, Ming Li",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07442v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07442v1,2020-01-21
"Explaining Data-Driven Decisions made by AI Systems: The Counterfactual
  Approach","Lack of understanding of the decisions made by model-based AI systems is an
important barrier for their adoption. We examine counterfactual explanations as
an alternative for explaining AI decisions. The counterfactual approach defines
an explanation as a set of the system's data inputs that causally drives the
decision (meaning that removing them changes the decision) and is irreducible
(meaning that removing any subset of the inputs in the explanation does not
change the decision). We generalize previous work on counterfactual
explanations, resulting in a framework that (a) is model-agnostic, (b) can
address features with arbitrary data types, (c) is able explain decisions made
by complex AI systems that incorporate multiple models, and (d) is scalable to
large numbers of features. We also propose a heuristic procedure to find the
most useful explanations depending on the context. We contrast counterfactual
explanations with another alternative: methods that explain model predictions
by weighting features according to their importance (e.g., SHAP, LIME). This
paper presents two fundamental reasons why explaining model predictions is not
the same as explaining the decisions made using those predictions, suggesting
we should carefully consider whether importance-weight explanations are
well-suited to explain decisions made by AI systems. Specifically, we show that
(1) features that have a large importance weight for a model prediction may not
actually affect the corresponding decision, and (2) importance weights are
insufficient to communicate whether and how features influence system
decisions. We demonstrate this using several examples, including three detailed
studies using real-world data that compare the counterfactual approach with
SHAP and illustrate various conditions under which counterfactual explanations
explain data-driven decisions better than feature importance weights.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG",3,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning",Xintian Han,"Carlos Fernandez, Foster Provost, Xintian Han",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07417v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07417v1,2020-01-21
A multi-agent ontologies-based clinical decision support system,"Clinical decision support systems combine knowledge and data from a variety
of sources, represented by quantitative models based on stochastic methods, or
qualitative based rather on expert heuristics and deductive reasoning. At the
same time, case-based reasoning (CBR) memorizes and returns the experience of
solving similar problems. The cooperation of heterogeneous clinical knowledge
bases (knowledge objects, semantic distances, evaluation functions, logical
rules, databases...) is based on medical ontologies. A multi-agent decision
support system (MADSS) enables the integration and cooperation of agents
specialized in different fields of knowledge (semiology, pharmacology, clinical
cases, etc.). Each specialist agent operates a knowledge base defining the
conduct to be maintained in conformity with the state of the art associated
with an ontological basis that expresses the semantic relationships between the
terms of the domain in question. Our approach is based on the specialization of
agents adapted to the knowledge models used during the clinical steps and
ontologies. This modular approach is suitable for the realization of MADSS in
many areas.",cs.AI,cs.AI,1,Artificial Intelligence,Artificial Intelligence,Joël Colloc,"Ying Shen, Jacquet-Andrieu Armelle, Joël Colloc",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07374v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07374v1,2020-01-21
"FixMatch: Simplifying Semi-Supervised Learning with Consistency and
  Confidence","Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective means of leveraging
unlabeled data to improve a model's performance. In this paper, we demonstrate
the power of a simple combination of two common SSL methods: consistency
regularization and pseudo-labeling. Our algorithm, FixMatch, first generates
pseudo-labels using the model's predictions on weakly-augmented unlabeled
images. For a given image, the pseudo-label is only retained if the model
produces a high-confidence prediction. The model is then trained to predict the
pseudo-label when fed a strongly-augmented version of the same image. Despite
its simplicity, we show that FixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a variety of standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, including
94.93% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels and 88.61% accuracy with 40 -- just
4 labels per class. Since FixMatch bears many similarities to existing SSL
methods that achieve worse performance, we carry out an extensive ablation
study to tease apart the experimental factors that are most important to
FixMatch's success. We make our code available at

"SAUNet: Shape Attentive U-Net for Interpretable Medical Image
  Segmentation","Medical image segmentation is a difficult but important task for many
clinical operations such as cardiac bi-ventricular volume estimation. More
recently, there has been a shift to utilizing deep learning and fully
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform image segmentation that has
yielded state-of-the-art results in many public benchmark datasets. Despite the
progress of deep learning in medical image segmentation, standard CNNs are
still not fully adopted in clinical settings as they lack robustness and
interpretability. Shapes are generally more meaningful features than solely
textures of images, which are features regular CNNs learn, causing a lack of
robustness. Likewise, previous works surrounding model interpretability have
been focused on post hoc gradient-based saliency methods. However,
gradient-based saliency methods typically require additional computations post
hoc and have been shown to be unreliable for interpretability. Thus, we present
a new architecture called Shape Attentive U-Net (SAUNet) which focuses on model
interpretability and robustness. The proposed architecture attempts to address
these limitations by the use of a secondary shape stream that captures rich
shape-dependent information in parallel with the regular texture stream.
Furthermore, we suggest multi-resolution saliency maps can be learned using our
dual-attention decoder module which allows for multi-level interpretability and
mitigates the need for additional computations post hoc. Our method also
achieves state-of-the-art results on the two large public cardiac MRI image

"Generate High-Resolution Adversarial Samples by Identifying Effective
  Features","As the prevalence of deep learning in computer vision, adversarial samples
that weaken the neural networks emerge in large numbers, revealing their
deep-rooted defects. Most adversarial attacks calculate an imperceptible
perturbation in image space to fool the DNNs. In this strategy, the
perturbation looks like noise and thus could be mitigated. Attacks in feature
space produce semantic perturbation, but they could only deal with low
resolution samples. The reason lies in the great number of coupled features to
express a high-resolution image. In this paper, we propose Attack by
Identifying Effective Features (AIEF), which learns different weights for
features to attack. Effective features, those with great weights, influence the
victim model much but distort the image little, and thus are more effective for
attack. By attacking mostly on them, AIEF produces high resolution adversarial
samples with acceptable distortions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AIEF
by attacking on different tasks with different generative models.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG",3,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Xiaolin Huang,"Sizhe Chen, Peidong Zhang, Chengjin Sun, Jia Cai, Xiaolin Huang",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07631v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07631v1,2020-01-21
"batchboost: regularization for stabilizing training with resistance to
  underfitting & overfitting","Overfitting & underfitting and stable training are an important challenges in
machine learning. Current approaches for these issues are mixup, SamplePairing
and BC learning. In our work, we state the hypothesis that mixing many images
together can be more effective than just two. Batchboost pipeline has three
stages: (a) pairing: method of selecting two samples. (b) mixing: how to create
a new one from two samples. (c) feeding: combining mixed samples with new ones
from dataset into batch (with ratio $\gamma$). Note that sample that appears in
our batch propagates with subsequent iterations with less and less importance
until the end of training. Pairing stage calculates the error per sample, sorts
the samples and pairs with strategy: hardest with easiest one, than mixing
stage merges two samples using mixup, $x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2$. Finally, feeding
stage combines new samples with mixed by ratio 1:1. Batchboost has 0.5-3%
better accuracy than the current state-of-the-art mixup regularization on
CIFAR-10 & Fashion-MNIST. Our method is slightly better than SamplePairing
technique on small datasets (up to 5%). Batchboost provides stable training on
not tuned parameters (like weight decay), thus its a good method to test
performance of different architectures. Source code is at:

PatchPerPix for Instance Segmentation,"In this paper we present a novel method for proposal free instance
segmentation that can handle sophisticated object shapes that span large parts
of an image and form dense object clusters with crossovers. Our method is based
on predicting dense local shape descriptors, which we assemble to form
instances. All instances are assembled simultaneously in one go. To our
knowledge, our method is the first non-iterative method that guarantees
instances to be composed of learnt shape patches. We evaluate our method on a
variety of data domains, where it defines the new state of the art on two
challenging benchmarks, namely the ISBI 2012 EM segmentation benchmark, and the
BBBC010 C. elegans dataset. We show furthermore that our method performs well

"Motif Difference Field: A Simple and Effective Image Representation of
  Time Series for Classification","Time series motifs play an important role in the time series analysis. The
motif-based time series clustering is used for the discovery of higher-order
patterns or structures in time series data. Inspired by the convolutional
neural network (CNN) classifier based on the image representations of time
series, motif difference field (MDF) is proposed. Compared to other image
representations of time series, MDF is simple and easy to construct. With the
Fully Convolution Network (FCN) as the classifier, MDF demonstrates the
superior performance on the UCR time series dataset in benchmark with other
time series classification methods. It is interesting to find that the triadic
time series motifs give the best result in the test. Due to the motif
clustering reflected in MDF, the significant motifs are detected with the help
of the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The areas in MDF
with high weight in Grad-CAM have a high contribution from the significant
motifs with the desired ordinal patterns associated with the signature patterns
in time series. However, the signature patterns cannot be identified with the
neural network classifiers directly based on the time series.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, cs.CV, cs.LG",3,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Xin Chen,"Yadong Zhang, Xin Chen",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07582v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07582v1,2020-01-21
Geometric Proxies for Live RGB-D Stream Enhancement and Consolidation,"We propose a geometric superstructure for unified real-time processing of
RGB-D data. Modern RGB-D sensors are widely used for indoor 3D capture, with
applications ranging from modeling to robotics, through augmented reality.
Nevertheless, their use is limited by their low resolution, with frames often
corrupted with noise, missing data and temporal inconsistencies. Our approach
consists in generating and updating through time a single set of compact local
statistics parameterized over detected geometric proxies, which are fed from
raw RGB-D data. Our proxies provide several processing primitives, which
improve the quality of the RGB-D stream on the fly or lighten further

Multimodal Deep Unfolding for Guided Image Super-Resolution,"The reconstruction of a high resolution image given a low resolution
observation is an ill-posed inverse problem in imaging. Deep learning methods
rely on training data to learn an end-to-end mapping from a low-resolution
input to a high-resolution output. Unlike existing deep multimodal models that
do not incorporate domain knowledge about the problem, we propose a multimodal
deep learning design that incorporates sparse priors and allows the effective
integration of information from another image modality into the network
architecture. Our solution relies on a novel deep unfolding operator,
performing steps similar to an iterative algorithm for convolutional sparse
coding with side information; therefore, the proposed neural network is
interpretable by design. The deep unfolding architecture is used as a core
component of a multimodal framework for guided image super-resolution. An
alternative multimodal design is investigated by employing residual learning to
improve the training efficiency. The presented multimodal approach is applied
to super-resolution of near-infrared and multi-spectral images as well as depth
upsampling using RGB images as side information. Experimental results show that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",eess.IV,"eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG",3,Image and Video Processing,"Image and Video Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Nikos Deligiannis,"Iman Marivani, Evaggelia Tsiligianni, Bruno Cornelis, Nikos Deligiannis",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07575v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07575v1,2020-01-21
"Joint Learning of Instance and Semantic Segmentation for Robotic
  Pick-and-Place with Heavy Occlusions in Clutter","We present joint learning of instance and semantic segmentation for visible
and occluded region masks. Sharing the feature extractor with instance
occlusion segmentation, we introduce semantic occlusion segmentation into the
instance segmentation model. This joint learning fuses the instance- and
image-level reasoning of the mask prediction on the different segmentation
tasks, which was missing in the previous work of learning instance segmentation
only (instance-only). In the experiments, we evaluated the proposed joint
learning comparing the instance-only learning on the test dataset. We also

P$^2$-GAN: Efficient Style Transfer Using Single Style Image,"Style transfer is a useful image synthesis technique that can re-render given
image into another artistic style while preserving its content information.
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a widely adopted framework toward this
task for its better representation ability on local style patterns than the
traditional Gram-matrix based methods. However, most previous methods rely on
sufficient amount of pre-collected style images to train the model. In this
paper, a novel Patch Permutation GAN (P$^2$-GAN) network that can efficiently
learn the stroke style from a single style image is proposed. We use patch
permutation to generate multiple training samples from the given style image. A
patch discriminator that can simultaneously process patch-wise images and
natural images seamlessly is designed. We also propose a local texture
descriptor based criterion to quantitatively evaluate the style transfer
quality. Experimental results showed that our method can produce finer quality
re-renderings from single style image with improved computational efficiency

Detecting Face2Face Facial Reenactment in Videos,"Visual content has become the primary source of information, as evident in
the billions of images and videos, shared and uploaded on the Internet every
single day. This has led to an increase in alterations in images and videos to
make them more informative and eye-catching for the viewers worldwide. Some of
these alterations are simple, like copy-move, and are easily detectable, while
other sophisticated alterations like reenactment based DeepFakes are hard to
detect. Reenactment alterations allow the source to change the target
expressions and create photo-realistic images and videos. While technology can
be potentially used for several applications, the malicious usage of automatic
reenactment has a very large social implication. It is therefore important to
develop detection techniques to distinguish real images and videos with the
altered ones. This research proposes a learning-based algorithm for detecting
reenactment based alterations. The proposed algorithm uses a multi-stream
network that learns regional artifacts and provides a robust performance at
various compression levels. We also propose a loss function for the balanced
learning of the streams for the proposed network. The performance is evaluated
on the publicly available FaceForensics dataset. The results show
state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 99.96%, 99.10%, and 91.20% for no,
easy, and hard compression factors, respectively.",cs.CV,cs.CV,1,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Richa Singh,"Prabhat Kumar, Mayank Vatsa, Richa Singh",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07444v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07444v1,2020-01-21
Evaluating Weakly Supervised Object Localization Methods Right,"Weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) has gained popularity over the
last years for its promise to train localization models with only image-level
labels. Since the seminal WSOL work of class activation mapping (CAM), the
field has focused on how to expand the attention regions to cover objects more
broadly and localize them better. However, these strategies rely on full
localization supervision to validate hyperparameters and for model selection,
which is in principle prohibited under the WSOL setup. In this paper, we argue
that WSOL task is ill-posed with only image-level labels, and propose a new
evaluation protocol where full supervision is limited to only a small held-out
set not overlapping with the test set. We observe that, under our protocol, the
five most recent WSOL methods have not made a major improvement over the CAM
baseline. Moreover, we report that existing WSOL methods have not reached the
few-shot learning baseline, where the full-supervision at validation time is
used for model training instead. Based on our findings, we discuss some future
directions for WSOL.",cs.CV,"cs.CV, cs.LG",2,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning",Hyunjung Shim,"Junsuk Choe, Seong Joon Oh, Seungho Lee, Sanghyuk Chun, Zeynep Akata, Hyunjung Shim",6,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07437v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07437v1,2020-01-21
Mobility Inference on Long-Tailed Sparse Trajectory,"Analyzing the urban trajectory in cities has become an important topic in
data mining. How can we model the human mobility consisting of stay and travel
from the raw trajectory data? How can we infer such a mobility model from the
single trajectory information? How can we further generalize the mobility
inference to accommodate the real-world trajectory data that is sparsely
sampled over time?
  In this paper, based on formal and rigid definitions of the stay/travel
mobility, we propose a single trajectory inference algorithm that utilizes a
generic long-tailed sparsity pattern in the large-scale trajectory data. The
algorithm guarantees a 100\% precision in the stay/travel inference with a
provable lower-bound in the recall. Furthermore, we introduce an
encoder-decoder learning architecture that admits multiple trajectories as
inputs. The architecture is optimized for the mobility inference problem
through customized embedding and learning mechanism. Evaluations with three
trajectory data sets of 40 million urban users validate the performance
guarantees of the proposed inference algorithm and demonstrate the superiority
of our deep learning model, in comparison to well-known sequence learning
methods. On extremely sparse trajectories, the deep learning model achieves a
2$\times$ overall accuracy improvement from the single trajectory inference
algorithm, through proven scalability and generalizability to large-scale
versatile training data.",cs.LG,"cs.SI, stat.ML, cs.LG",3,Machine Learning,"Social and Information Networks, Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Lei Shi,Lei Shi,1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07636v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07636v1,2020-01-21
EdgeNets:Edge Varying Graph Neural Networks,"Driven by the outstanding performance of neural networks in the structured
Euclidean domain, recent years have seen a surge of interest in developing
neural networks for graphs and data supported on graphs. The graph is leveraged
as a parameterization to capture detail at the node level with a reduced number
of parameters and complexity. Following this rationale, this paper puts forth a
general framework that unifies state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs)
through the concept of EdgeNet. An EdgeNet is a GNN architecture that allows
different nodes to use different parameters to weigh the information of
different neighbors. By extrapolating this strategy to more iterations between
neighboring nodes, the EdgeNet learns edge- and neighbor-dependent weights to
capture local detail. This is the most general local operation that a node can
do and encompasses under one formulation all graph convolutional neural
networks (GCNNs) as well as graph attention networks (GATs). In writing
different GNN architectures with a common language, EdgeNets highlight specific
architecture advantages and limitations, while providing guidelines to improve
their capacity without compromising their local implementation. For instance,
we show that GCNNs have a parameter sharing structure that induces permutation
equivariance. This can be an advantage or a limitation, depending on the
application. When it is a limitation, we propose hybrid approaches and provide
insights to develop several other solutions that promote parameter sharing
without enforcing permutation equivariance. Another interesting conclusion is
the unification of GCNNs and GATs -approaches that have been so far perceived
as separate. In particular, we show that GATs are GCNNs on a graph that is
learned from the features. This particularization opens the doors to develop
alternative attention mechanisms for improving discriminatory power.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, eess.SP, cs.NE, cs.LG",4,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Neural and Evolutionary Computing, Machine Learning",Alejandro Ribeiro,"Elvin Isufi, Fernando Gama, Alejandro Ribeiro",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07620v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07620v1,2020-01-21

inequalities (a) in the algorithm as a criterion in iterations and (b) to
provide an upper bound for cumulative regret, which is a measure of algorithm
performance. In this work, we utilized method of mixtures and asymptotic
expansions of certain implicit function to provide a tighter, iterated-log-like

Simple and Effective Graph Autoencoders with One-Hop Linear Models,"Graph autoencoders (AE) and variational autoencoders (VAE) recently emerged
as powerful node embedding methods, with promising performances on challenging
tasks such as link prediction and node clustering. Graph AE, VAE and most of
their extensions rely on graph convolutional networks (GCN) encoders to learn
vector space representations of nodes. In this paper, we propose to replace the
GCN encoder by a significantly simpler linear model w.r.t. the direct
neighborhood (one-hop) adjacency matrix of the graph. For the two
aforementioned tasks, we show that this approach consistently reaches
competitive performances w.r.t. GCN-based models for numerous real-world
graphs, including all benchmark datasets commonly used to evaluate graph AE and
VAE. We question the relevance of repeatedly using these datasets to compare
complex graph AE and VAE. We also emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed
encoding scheme, that appears as a simpler and faster alternative to GCN
encoders for many real-world applications.",cs.LG,"cs.SI, stat.ML, cs.LG",3,Machine Learning,"Social and Information Networks, Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Michalis Vazirgiannis,"Guillaume Salha, Romain Hennequin, Michalis Vazirgiannis",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07614v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07614v1,2020-01-21
"R2DE: a NLP approach to estimating IRT parameters of newly generated
  questions","The main objective of exams consists in performing an assessment of students'
expertise on a specific subject. Such expertise, also referred to as skill or
knowledge level, can then be leveraged in different ways (e.g., to assign a
grade to the students, to understand whether a student might need some support,
etc.). Similarly, the questions appearing in the exams have to be assessed in
some way before being used to evaluate students. Standard approaches to
questions' assessment are either subjective (e.g., assessment by human experts)
or introduce a long delay in the process of question generation (e.g.,
pretesting with real students). In this work we introduce R2DE (which is a
Regressor for Difficulty and Discrimination Estimation), a model capable of
assessing newly generated multiple-choice questions by looking at the text of
the question and the text of the possible choices. In particular, it can
estimate the difficulty and the discrimination of each question, as they are
defined in Item Response Theory. We also present the results of extensive
experiments we carried out on a real world large scale dataset coming from an
e-learning platform, showing that our model can be used to perform an initial
assessment of newly created questions and ease some of the problems that arise
in question generation.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, cs.CL, cs.LG",3,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Computation and Language, Machine Learning",Paolo Cremonesi,"Luca Benedetto, Andrea Cappelli, Roberto Turrin, Paolo Cremonesi",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07569v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07569v1,2020-01-21
"Classifying Wikipedia in a fine-grained hierarchy: what graphs can
  contribute","Wikipedia is a huge opportunity for machine learning, being the largest
semi-structured base of knowledge available. Because of this, countless works
examine its contents, and focus on structuring it in order to make it usable in
learning tasks, for example by classifying it into an ontology. Beyond its
textual contents, Wikipedia also displays a typical graph structure, where
pages are linked together through citations. In this paper, we address the task
of integrating graph (i.e. structure) information to classify Wikipedia into a
fine-grained named entity ontology (NE), the Extended Named Entity hierarchy.
To address this task, we first start by assessing the relevance of the graph
structure for NE classification. We then explore two directions, one related to
feature vectors using graph descriptors commonly used in large-scale network
analysis, and one extending flat classification to a weighted model taking into
account semantic similarity. We conduct at-scale practical experiments, on a
manually labeled subset of 22,000 pages extracted from the Japanese Wikipedia.
Our results show that integrating graph information succeeds at reducing
sparsity of the input feature space, and yields classification results that are
comparable or better than previous works.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, cs.LG",2,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Machine Learning",Satoshi Sekine,"Tiphaine Viard, Thomas McLachlan, Hamidreza Ghader, Satoshi Sekine",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07558v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07558v1,2020-01-21

differences in the population structure,fitness evaluation and genetic
operators. We have tested this method oneight binary classification problems,

Towards Fault Localization via Probabilistic Software Modeling,"Software testing helps developers to identify bugs. However, awareness of
bugs is only the first step. Finding and correcting the faulty program
components is equally hard and essential for high-quality software. Fault
localization automatically pinpoints the location of an existing bug in a
program. It is a hard problem, and existing methods are not yet precise enough
for widespread industrial adoption. We propose fault localization via
Probabilistic Software Modeling (PSM). PSM analyzes the structure and behavior
of a program and synthesizes a network of Probabilistic Models (PMs). Each PM
models a method with its inputs and outputs and is capable of evaluating the
likelihood of runtime data. We use this likelihood evaluation to find fault

behavior of a program and synthesizes a network of Probabilistic Models (PMs).
Each PM in the network represents a method in the program and is capable of
generating and evaluating runtime events. We leverage these capabilities to
accurately find semantic clones. Results show that the approach can detect
semantic clones in the complete absence of syntactic similarity with high

which depends on the degree of the jumps in the one-dimensional setting. We

"An arbitrary-order Cell Method with block-diagonal mass-matrices for the

basis-functions yields cheaply invertible block-diagonal system matrices for
the discrete time-stepping scheme. The main novelty of the present contribution
lies in incorporating arbitrary polynomial degree in the approximating
functional spaces, defined through a new reference cell. The presented method,
albeit a kind of Discontinuous Galerkin approach, requires neither the
introduction of user-tuned penalty parameters for the tangential jump of the

fixations. Something has gone wrong. Also, the treatment of some inter-fixation
intervals as saccades that might have been identified by human experts is
completely unjustified. The results regarding these saccades are without merit

Understanding the role of phenotypic switching in cancer drug resistance,"The emergence of acquired drug resistance in cancer represents a major
barrier to treatment success. While research has traditionally focused on
genetic sources of resistance, recent findings suggest that cancer cells can
acquire transient resistant phenotypes via epigenetic modifications and other
non-genetic mechanisms. Although these resistant phenotypes are eventually
relinquished by individual cells, they can temporarily 'save' the tumor from
extinction and enable the emergence of more permanent resistance mechanisms.
These observations have generated interest in the potential of epigenetic
therapies for long-term tumor control or eradication. In this work, we develop
a mathematical model to study how phenotypic switching at the single-cell level
affects resistance evolution in cancer. We highlight unique features of
non-genetic resistance, probe the evolutionary consequences of epigenetic drugs
and explore potential therapeutic strategies. We find that even short-term
epigenetic modifications and stochastic fluctuations in gene expression can
drive long-term drug resistance in the absence of any bona fide resistance
mechanisms. We also find that an epigenetic drug that slightly perturbs the
average retention of the resistant phenotype can turn guaranteed treatment
failure into guaranteed success. Lastly, we find that combining an epigenetic
drug with an anti-cancer agent can significantly outperform monotherapy, and
that treatment outcome is heavily affected by drug sequencing.",q-bio.PE,"q-bio.PE, q-bio.QM, 92D25, 92B05, 60J85",3,Populations and Evolution,"Populations and Evolution, Quantitative Methods",Jasmine Foo,"Einar Bjarki Gunnarsson, Subhajyoti De, Kevin Leder, Jasmine Foo",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07690v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07690v1,2020-01-21
Bisimilar Conversion of Multi-valued Networks to Boolean Networks,"Discrete modelling frameworks of Biological networks can be divided in two
distinct categories: Boolean and Multi-valued. Although Multi-valued networks
are more expressive for qualifying the regulatory behaviours modelled by more
than two values, the ability to automatically convert them to Boolean network
with an equivalent behaviour breaks down the fundamental borders between the
two approaches. Theoretically investigating the conversion process provides
relevant insights into bridging the gap between them. Basically, the conversion
aims at finding a Boolean network bisimulating a Multi-valued one. In this
article, we investigate the bisimilar conversion where the Boolean integer
coding is a parameter that can be freely modified. Based on this analysis, we
define a computational method automatically inferring a bisimilar Boolean
network from a given Multi-valued one.",cs.DM,"cs.SC, cs.DM, q-bio.QM",3,Discrete Mathematics,"Symbolic Computation, Discrete Mathematics, Quantitative Methods",Sergiu Ivanov,"Franck Delaplace, Sergiu Ivanov",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07371v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07371v1,2020-01-21
"Estimating locomotor demands during team play from broadcast-derived
  tracking data","The introduction of optical tracking data across sports has given rise to the
ability to dissect athletic performance at a level unfathomable a decade ago.
One specific area that has seen substantial benefit is sports science, as high
resolution coordinate data permits sports scientists to have to-the-second
estimates of external load metrics, such as acceleration load and high speed
running distance, traditionally used to understand the physical toll a game
takes on an athlete. Unfortunately, collecting this data requires installation
of expensive hardware and paying costly licensing fees to data providers,
restricting its availability. Algorithms have been developed that allow a
traditional broadcast feed to be converted to x-y coordinate data, making
tracking data easier to acquire, but coordinates are available for an athlete
only when that player is within the camera frame. Obviously, this leads to
inaccuracies in player load estimates, limiting the usefulness of this data for
sports scientists. In this research, we develop models that predict offscreen
load metrics and demonstrate the viability of broadcast-derived tracking data
for understanding external load in soccer.",stat.AP,stat.AP,1,Applications,Applications,Luke Bornn,"Jacob Mortensen, Luke Bornn",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07692v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07692v1,2020-01-21
"How Fast You Can Actually Fly: A Comparative Investigation of Flight
  Airborne Time in China and the U.S","Actual airborne time (AAT) is the time between wheels-off and wheels-on of a
flight. Understanding the behavior of AAT is increasingly important given the
ever growing demand for air travel and flight delays becoming more rampant. As
no research on AAT exists, this paper performs the first empirical analysis of
AAT behavior, comparatively for the U.S. and China. The focus is on how AAT is
affected by scheduled block time (SBT), origin-destination (OD) distance, and
the possible pressure to reduce AAT from other parts of flight operations.
Multiple econometric models are developed. The estimation results show that in
both countries AAT is highly correlated with SBT and OD distance. Flights in
the U.S. are faster than in China. On the other hand, facing ground delay prior
to takeoff, a flight has limited capability to speed up. The pressure from
short turnaround time after landing to reduce AAT is immaterial. Sensitivity
analysis of AAT to flight length and aircraft utilization is further conducted.
Given the more abundant airspace, flexible routing networks, and efficient ATFM
procedures, a counterfactual that the AAT behavior in the U.S. were adopted in
China is examined. We find that by doing so significant efficiency gains could
be achieved in the Chinese air traffic system. On average, 11.8 minutes of AAT
per flight would be saved, coming from both reduction in SBT and reduction in
AAT relative to the new SBT. Systemwide fuel saving would amount to over 300
million gallons with direct airline operating cost saving of nearly $1.3
billion nationwide in 2016.",stat.AP,"62P30, stat.AP",2,Applications,Applications,Mark Hansen,"Ke Liu, Zhe Zheng, Bo Zou, Mark Hansen",4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07646v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07646v1,2020-01-21
how well can sensitivity and sojourn time be estimated,"Chronic disease progression models are governed by three main parameters:
sensitivity, preclinical intensity, and sojourn time. The estimation of these
parameters helps in optimizing screening programs and examine the improvement
in survival. Multiple approaches exist to estimate those parameters. However,
these models are based on strong underlying assumptions. The main aim of this
article is to investigate the effect of these assumptions. For this purpose, we
developed a simulator to mimic a breast cancer screening program directly
observing the exact onset and the sojourn time of the disease. We investigate
the effects of assuming the sensitivity to be constant, inter-screening
interval and misspecifying the sojourn time. Our results indicate a strong
correlation between the estimated parameters, and that the chosen sojourn
time-distribution has a strong effect on the accuracy of the estimation. These
findings shed a light on the seemingly discrepant results got by different
authors using the same data sets but different assumptions.",stat.AP,stat.AP,1,Applications,Applications,András Zempléni,"Ayman Hijazy, András Zempléni",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07469v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07469v1,2020-01-21
"Bayesian Spatial Models for Voxel-wise Prostate Cancer Classification
  Using Multi-parametric MRI Data","Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) plays an increasingly
important role in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Various computer-aided
detection algorithms have been proposed for automated prostate cancer detection
by combining information from various mpMRI data components. However, there
exist other features of mpMRI, including the spatial correlation between voxels
and between-patient heterogeneity in the mpMRI parameters, that have not been
fully explored in the literature but could potentially improve cancer detection
if leveraged appropriately. This paper proposes novel voxel-wise Bayesian
classifiers for prostate cancer that account for the spatial correlation and
between-patient heterogeneity in mpMRI. Modeling the spatial correlation is
challenging due to the extreme high dimensionality of the data, and we consider
three computationally efficient approaches using Nearest Neighbor Gaussian
Process (NNGP), knot-based reduced-rank approximation, and a conditional
autoregressive (CAR) model, respectively. The between-patient heterogeneity is
accounted for by adding a subject-specific random intercept on the mpMRI
parameter model. Simulation results show that properly modeling the spatial
correlation and between-patient heterogeneity improves classification accuracy.
Application to in vivo data illustrates that classification is improved by
spatial modeling using NNGP and reduced-rank approximation but not the CAR
model, while modeling the between-patient heterogeneity does not further
improve our classifier. Among our proposed models, the NNGP-based model is
recommended considering its robust classification accuracy and high
computational efficiency.",stat.AP,stat.AP,1,Applications,Applications,Joseph S. Koopmeiners,"Jin Jin, Lin Zhang, Ethan Leng, Gregory J. Metzger, Joseph S. Koopmeiners",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07316v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07316v1,2020-01-21
"MonteCarloMeasurements.jl: Nonlinear Propagation of Arbitrary
  Multivariate Distributions by means of Method Overloading","This manuscript outlines a software package that facilitates working with
probability distributions by means of Monte-Carlo methods, in a way that allows
for propagation of multivariate probability distributions through arbitrary
functions. We provide a \emph{type} that represents probability distributions
by an internal vector of unweighted samples, \texttt{Particles}, which is a
subtype of a \texttt{Real} number and behaves just like a regular real number
in calculations by means of method overloading. This makes the software easy to
work with and presents minimal friction for the user. We highlight how this
design facilitates optimal usage of SIMD instructions and showcase the package
for uncertainty propagation through an off-the-shelf ODE solver, as well as for
robust probabilistic optimization with automatic differentiation.",cs.MS,"stat.OT, cs.MS, stat.CO",3,Mathematical Software,"Other Statistics, Mathematical Software, Computation",Fredrik Bagge Carlson,Fredrik Bagge Carlson,1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07625v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07625v1,2020-01-21
"Clinical Prediction Models to Predict the Risk of Multiple Binary
  Outcomes: a comparison of approaches","Clinical prediction models (CPMs) are used to predict clinically relevant
outcomes or events. Typically, prognostic CPMs are derived to predict the risk
of a single future outcome. However, with rising emphasis on the prediction of
multi-morbidity, there is growing need for CPMs to simultaneously predict risks
for each of multiple future outcomes. A common approach to multi-outcome risk
prediction is to derive a CPM for each outcome separately, then multiply the
predicted risks. This approach is only valid if the outcomes are conditionally
independent given the covariates, and it fails to exploit the potential
relationships between the outcomes. This paper outlines several approaches that
could be used to develop prognostic CPMs for multiple outcomes. We consider
four methods, ranging in complexity and assumed conditional independence
assumptions: namely, probabilistic classifier chain, multinomial logistic
regression, multivariate logistic regression, and a Bayesian probit model.
These are compared with methods that rely on conditional independence: separate
univariate CPMs and stacked regression. Employing a simulation study and
real-world example via the MIMIC-III database, we illustrate that CPMs for
joint risk prediction of multiple outcomes should only be derived using methods
that model the residual correlation between outcomes. In such a situation, our
results suggest that probabilistic classification chains, multinomial logistic
regression or the Bayesian probit model are all appropriate choices. We call
into question the development of CPMs for each outcome in isolation when
multiple correlated or structurally related outcomes are of interest and
recommend more holistic risk prediction.",stat.ME,stat.ME,1,Methodology,Methodology,Richard D. Riley,"Glen P. Martin, Matthew Sperrin, Kym I. E. Snell, Iain Buchan, Richard D. Riley",5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07624v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07624v1,2020-01-21
"Understanding the stochastic partial differential equation approach to
  smoothing","Correlation and smoothness are terms used to describe a wide variety of
random quantities. In time, space, and many other domains, they both imply the
same idea: quantities that occur closer together are more similar than those
further apart. Two popular statistical models that represent this idea are
basis-penalty smoothers (Wood, 2017) and stochastic partial differential
equations (SPDE) (Lindgren et al., 2011). In this paper, we discuss how the
SPDE can be interpreted as a smoothing penalty and can be fitted using the R
package mgcv, allowing practitioners with existing knowledge of smoothing
penalties to better understand the implementation and theory behind the SPDE
approach.",stat.ME,stat.ME,1,Methodology,Methodology,Andrew E Seaton,"David L Miller, Richard Glennie, Andrew E Seaton",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07623v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07623v1,2020-01-21
Learning to Control PDEs with Differentiable Physics,"Predicting outcomes and planning interactions with the physical world are
long-standing goals for machine learning. A variety of such tasks involves
continuous physical systems, which can be described by partial differential
equations (PDEs) with many degrees of freedom. Existing methods that aim to
control the dynamics of such systems are typically limited to relatively short
time frames or a small number of interaction parameters. We present a novel
hierarchical predictor-corrector scheme which enables neural networks to learn
to understand and control complex nonlinear physical systems over long time
frames. We propose to split the problem into two distinct tasks: planning and
control. To this end, we introduce a predictor network that plans optimal
trajectories and a control network that infers the corresponding control
parameters. Both stages are trained end-to-end using a differentiable PDE
solver. We demonstrate that our method successfully develops an understanding
of complex physical systems and learns to control them for tasks involving PDEs
such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.",cs.LG,"stat.ML, physics.flu-dyn, cs.LG",3,Machine Learning,"Machine Learning, Fluid Dynamics, Machine Learning",Nils Thuerey,"Philipp Holl, Vladlen Koltun, Nils Thuerey",3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07457v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07457v1,2020-01-21

"The Principled Prediction-Problem Ontology: when black box algorithms
  are (not) appropriate","Black-box algorithms have had astonishing success in some settings. But their
unpredictable brittleness has provoked serious concern and increased scrutiny.
For any given black-box algorithm understanding where it might fail is
extraordinarily challenging. In contrast, understanding which settings are not
appropriate for black-box deployment requires no more than understanding simply
how they are developed. We introduce a framework that isolates four
problem-features -- measurement, adaptability, resilience, and agnosis -- which
need to be carefully considered before selecting an algorithm. This paper lays
out a principled framework, justified through careful decomposition of the
system components used to develop black-box algorithms, for people to
understand and discuss where black-box algorithms are appropriate and, more
frequently, where they are not appropriate.",stat.OT,stat.OT,1,Other Statistics,Other Statistics,Michael Baiocchi,"Jordan Rodu, Michael Baiocchi",2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07648v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07648v1,2020-01-21
